       "  'While pinning Trump case to campaign laws, Bragg eyes a backup plan | The Hill',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nThe much-awaited charges against Donald Trump show Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) plans to largely rest on campaign laws to prosecute the former president for obscuring his reimbursement of hush money payments.\\nBut sprinkled into charging documents and public statements from Bragg are references to tax law violations — a sign New York prosecutors may be hedging their bets by bringing a broader\\xa0case against the former president.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nTrump was charged on 34 felony counts during his arraignment Tuesday, each stemming from an arrangement Trump made with fixer Michael Cohen after he\\xa0made a $130,000 payment\\xa0to adult film star Stormy Daniels.\\nThe case is built on falsification of business records charges, with prosecutors arguing the “unlawful scheme” violated election laws.\\n“The defendant orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election by identifying and purchasing negative information about him to suppress its publication and benefit the defendant’s electoral prospects,” Bragg’s office wrote in a statement of facts accompanying the bare bones indictment.\\nHush money payments are not illegal, but when Trump reimbursed Cohen for the payoff, the funds were characterized as legal expenses.\\nFalsifying business records is a misdemeanor under New York law, one that can be bumped to a felony when done to obscure another crime.\\nThe financial crimes that serve as the underlying basis for Trump’s prosecution are what Bragg referred to as the “bread and butter” of his office, located in the financial capital of the world.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nBut in hanging much of the case on election laws, Bragg delves into more complex territory, one that requires demonstrating the payments were made in an effort to influence the election as well as grappling with Trump’s status as a federal candidate in the state-level prosecution.\\nBragg outlined two voting statutes he alleges Trump violated.\\n“The scheme violated New York election law, which makes it a crime to conspire to promote a candidacy by unlawful means. The $130,000 wire payment exceeded the federal campaign contribution cap,” he said.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nBragg’s choice of state law is a telling one. In choosing that statute, the prosecutor sidestepped other options under New York law, including those dealing with state campaign finance violations that may have problematic language when it comes to dealing with a federal candidate.\\nMeanwhile, exceeding campaign contribution limits, a federal crime, is the same crime Cohen pleaded guilty to, one that will require showing the spending was done to influence the election.\\nTrump’s attorneys have already begun to counter both.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nTodd Blanche, defense attorney for former President Trump, leaves Manhattan criminal court April 4 in New York. Trump appeared in a New York City courtroom on charges related to falsifying business records in a hush money investigation, the first president ever to be charged with a crime. (AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\\nThey’ve argued the payout to Daniels via Cohen was not to win the election, but rather save Trump’s marriage by burying the story of a sexual encounter he denies.\\xa0And they’ve said that the state doesn’t have the power to prosecute Trump, a federal candidate, on either state or federal charges, asserting that such charges would have to come from a federal prosecutor.\\n“We’re not going to get to a jury… I think this case is going to fall on its merits, on legal challenges well before we get to a jury,” Trump attorney Joe Tacopina said in a Wednesday morning interview on NBC News.\\nBragg does appear to have evidence Trump saw the payout through the lens of the election. Trump allegedly told Cohen, according to paraphrasing of the conversation detailed in court documents, that “if they could delay the payment until after the election, they could avoid paying altogether, because at that point it would not matter if the story became public.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nNorm Eisen, counsel for Democrats in Trump’s first impeachment, has encouraged Bragg to bring charges under both federal and state election laws.\\n“Look, it can’t be that Donald Trump lives in some special universe when neither state nor federal campaign law applies to him. It has to be that one or the other applies, and I don’t think that a judge is going to buy into that Catch-22,” he told The Hill.\\nBut Bragg implied there may be more charges to the case.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe statement of facts notes that Trump’s organization inflated payments to Cohen to account for the taxes the fixer would have to pay on what was being reported as income rather than a reimbursement.\\xa0\\n“If Trump knows about that, was aware of that, and approved of the falsification of the records in order to conceal the hush money payments and in order to allow Michael Cohen to get a full repayment for the hush money payments he had made, then the tax violation here — offering a false instrument for filing — is in fact one of the crimes that is being covered up through the falsification of business records,” said Josh Stanton, an attorney with Perry Guha who has penned analyses of Bragg’s case.\\xa0\\nThe documents say Trump and others “mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the payments made in furtherance of the scheme,” but when asked to elaborate, Bragg declined.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I’m not going to go beyond the plain language in the statement of facts, we think it speaks for itself,” he said in a press conference with reporters just after Trump’s arraignment concluded.\\nEisen said the tax statute does give Bragg additional options as he builds his case. Attorneys aren’t expected in court again until December on the matter.\\n“The DA is notifying Trump and all of us this may be an issue that he will litigate at trial. You know, it’s very common for prosecutors to cast a broad net and then to focus in on their case,” Eisen said.\\n“Think of it this way. There’s two campaign finance [violations]. There’s state campaign finance violations; federal campaign finance violations — that’s belt and suspenders. This is an additional possibility. Think of it as belt, suspenders, and duct tape. He’s taking no chances on holding up his case, and there’s nothing wrong with that.”\\nTrump on Tuesday pleaded not guilty on all 34 counts, but it’s still not entirely clear what charges Bragg plans to bring.\\nTrump’s attorneys must file a bill of particulars in order to get the full scope of Bragg’s claims.\\n“They do not have to specify the crime at this juncture; they will have to down the road. And the best way to read the sprinkling of the reference to potential tax violation is that they are clearly reserving the right to use that state tax statute as a third way of elevating what would ordinarily be a misdemeanor into a felony,” said Jeff Robbins, a former prosecutor now in private practice.\\nThe dozens of charges reflect each of the checks that Trump signed to Cohen, at least nine of which he signed directly.\\xa0\\nStanton noted it’s not unusual for prosecutors to hold back on some elements of their case.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tTrump’s New York legal drama: What’s next\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tTrump awarded more than $121,000 in legal fees from Stormy Daniels just hours after arraignment\\t\\n\\n“This is a lot of counts, but it’s really a simple indictment: Trump is charged with falsifying business records in his repayments to Michael Cohen through 11 checks in 2017, including\\xa0nine\\xa0he signed personally,” he said.\\xa0\\n“The detailed Statement of Facts makes plain that Bragg is pursuing both campaign finance violations, as well as tax offenses to bump up the charges to felonies. He need not say that outright in the indictment. Indeed, that’s normal.”\\xa0\\nUpdated at 5:36 p.m.\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nFormer President Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday kicked off months of proceedings that will stretch well into the 2024 campaign season.\\nBeyond learning the 34 felony charges Trump is accused of, the court proceedings also set the stage for the legal battles to come: deadlines for Trump’s attempt to dismiss the indictment, a trial date agreement and a battle over media access.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHere’s a look at what happens next in the case:\\nDiscovery\\nAfter their multi-year investigation, prosecutors in the coming days will begin providing the evidence they collected to Trump’s legal team.\\nBecky Mangold, a prosecutor in the district attorney’s Major Economic Crimes Bureau, at Tuesday’s arraignment indicated the documents would come in three stages.\\nFirst, she said prosecutors could provide within a week the stenographic grand jury minutes and notes of witness statements for those who appeared during the secret proceedings.\\nSecond — comprising the bulk of the materials — the district attorney’s office will produce other witness documents, subpoena compliance information and other materials Mangold described as “odds and ends.” Those documents will be produced within 65 days of the arraignment, she said.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFinally, a possible third stage could include internal emails between district attorney employees and any remaining documents, although Mangold did not provide a timeline for those disclosures.\\nBefore any documents are produced, however, both sides indicated they are hashing out an agreement on a protective order, which would place certain rules on the process.\\nMangold said prosecutors want an order preventing Trump and his lawyers from using the produced materials for purposes other than preparing for the case, including providing them to the press or posting them on social media.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“A protective order is vital to preserve the sanctity of these proceedings,” Mangold said.\\nSusan Necheles, one of Trump’s attorneys, during the arraignment said, “we hope to reach an agreement,” although there appeared to be some outstanding issues, including what locations Trump would be able to view the produced documents.\\nTrump will try to dismiss\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAfter discovery, Trump’s legal team is expected to attempt to dismiss the indictment. Both before and after Tuesday’s proceeding, Trump attorney Joe Tacopina publicly vowed to do so.\\n“We’re not going to get to a jury… I think this case is going to fall on its merits, on legal challenges well before we get to a jury,” he said on NBC’s “TODAY” show on Wednesday.\\nUnder New York’s criminal procedure law, nine possible grounds exist for Trump to ask the judge to dismiss the case or to throw out specific counts.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThose grounds include arguing that prosecutors did not show legally sufficient evidence to the grand jury or that the charges had passed the statute of limitations. One of the other possible routes, known as a Clayton motion, allows the former president to seek dismissal by arguing it “is required in the interest of justice.”\\nIn that scenario, the judge would be compelled to consider factors like\\xa0any “exceptionally serious misconduct” of law enforcement, a dismissal’s impact on public confidence in the criminal justice system and the seriousness of the offense.\\nOn Tuesday, Justice Juan Merchan set deadlines for the dismissal stage.

And in Wisconsin, judge Janet Protasiewicz used a vacancy on the state’s Supreme Court to send an abortion-rights message to voters who won Democrats control of the judicial body for the first time in years.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe results come as progressives are seeking new ways to gain traction ahead of the next election cycle. The practical barriers of a Republican-controlled House and President Biden’s pre-campaign pivot to the center have blunted their influence in Washington, but the latest results show left-wing candidates are finding new ways to make headway at the state and local levels as their focus shifts beyond D.C.\\xa0\\n“Moderate Democrats are playing to a mythical center, but these elections prove success lies in playing to your own base,” Marianne Williamson, a progressive spiritual author who is challenging Biden for the 2024 nomination, told The Hill on Wednesday. “Treating progressives in the party like we’re unruly children who need to sit down and let the grown-ups do what they do will be an increasingly losing strategy.”\\nJohnson, a teachers union advocate who earned the public support of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), faced a steep hill to victory. Up against Paul Vallas, a pro-law enforcement and well-funded moderate, Johnson was characterized by some Democrats as part of the wave of too-left candidates who contributed to down-ballot losses in November, when liberals tossed valuable House seats to Republicans in part over their stances on crime.\\xa0\\nJohnson’s victory from the left in one of the country’s top cities has complicated the emerging narrative around crime ahead of the next presidential contest, where centrists including Biden have adopted a stricter posture to guard against potential attacks.\\xa0\\nProgressives, including sources close to Sanders, have cautioned that going in that direction can alienate key constituencies. That’s especially the case, they say, when considering large voting blocs like young people or others who may be less engaged or may not be part of the Democratic Party’s traditional base.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We won’t win elections by purposely shrinking our own base,” Williamson said. “We’ll win elections by embracing, not suppressing, the new and vibrant progressive energy rising up all around the country.

John Fetterman, a populist in Pennsylvania, and Raphael Warnock, a center-left Democrat in Georgia, won their Senate seats by making direct appeals to voters by at times veering to the left of the party.\\n“What Brandon Johnson demonstrated, in a way similar to Fetterman and even Warnock in Georgia, was that progressive ideas are popular,” said Stacey Walker, an activist who was a surrogate for Sanders in the Midwest. “When they are explained, they can excite the base and drive turnout.”\\xa0\\nMuch of the rhetoric from Vallas — who was supported by the city’s\\xa0Fraternal Order of Police — centered around violent crime and his plan to add more troops as a solution. Some drew parallels between the effectiveness of that style for Mayor Eric Adams in New York City, who won over residents by taking a more centrist position around crime and policing than his liberal opponents.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFor part of the night, it looked like it would work in Vallas’s favor too. The former CEO of Chicago Public Schools led Johnson at several junctures and ultimately came within striking distance of him before conceding. Vallas stressed unity in his concession speech, saying, “the only pathway forward in our city is together.”\\nTo progressives, the results were a sign that they can continue to make inroads at the edges of races where a few hundred votes could determine the outcome.\\n“Johnson, a relative political-newcomer, did this in one of America’s most diverse cities, and took out a well-funded opponent who ran on a moderate message, filled with the same ‘tough on crime’ dog-whistles that have become common practice in the Republican playbook, and even in some for Democrats,” Walker said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nBeyond the more localized city messaging, progressives believe both results show a renewed interest in grassroots organizing, where different tactics for outreach can be tailored to voters and against the opponent.\\xa0\\xa0\\nProtasiewicz, a\\xa0Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge,\\xa0faced a different hurdle in Wisconsin, where Democrats feared the state’s often unpredictable electorate was at risk of sliding firmly into Republican territory.\\xa0\\nIf they lost the court seat, many worried there would be even greater challenges over massive issues like abortion access. Organizers focused heavily on that aspect, drawing on Protasiewicz’s abortion-rights platform, which aligned with national Democrats after the Supreme Court’s ruling to overturn Roe v. Wade last summer outraged the party at large. She seized on a promise to protect reproductive rights in her state, whereas her opponent\\xa0Dan Kelly, a staunch conservative former state Supreme Court justice, ran on an anti-abortion stance.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nSpecial interest groups each spent heavily in the race, drawing additional money and putting a spotlight on the national significance.\\n“If this race is an early bellwether, we can safely say that Republicans didn’t learn their lesson in 2022,” said\\xa0Sarah Dohl, who serves as chief campaigns officer at the progressive group Indivisible, which was heavily involved in the race.\\nDohl, too, made comparisons to the recent Georgia election, where activists reached new levels of investments in communications with voters through texting and soliciting small dollar donations.\\xa0“For a state Supreme Court race in an off-year election, that’s unheard of,” she said.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe focus on women’s rights and choice — and its positive returns for Democrats — cleared up a question that was percolating within the party post-midterms. The issue proved to be a motivating factor in several key races, but as economic concerns like inflation and the high price of goods continued to rise, some cautioned against using it as a closing pitch to voters in the fall.\\nProtasiewicz’s election over Kelly\\xa0gave progressives reassurance that they can make strong abortion-rights cases to swing electorates — especially since Wisconsin is one of the presidential map’s most crucial battlegrounds, with both sides seeing it as within their grasp.\\n“What I found to be remarkable about Wisconsin was how progressive groups demonstrated their strength in an off-year election, mobilizing voters, many of them young, around issues,” Walker said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\nWhile\\xa0Protasiewicz arguably was more in line with mainstream Democrats,\\xa0progressives still see a notch for their side in her victory. Like in Chicago, they view the organizing prowess of liberal organizations and individual volunteers as critical to her victory.\\xa0\\nAnd while abortion proved to be a leading topic on Tuesday, progressives also say there are other areas where Democrats can make headway, including with redistricting and voting rights.\\xa0\\n“In the end, issues like abortion, gerrymandering and voter protection for marginalized communities weren’t wedge issues, but rather the motivating force for the Democratic base,” Walker said.\\xa0\\n\\n'),\n",

No, you’re not.”\\xa0\\nCotham’s decision has massive implications for politics in the state. Republicans came out of the 2022 election cycle winning a supermajority in the state Senate outright, but falling one seat short of a supermajority in the state House.\\xa0\\nCotham’s party switch virtually ensures that Democratic state lawmakers won’t be able to uphold Gov. Roy Cooper’s (D) vetoes, so long as all members are voting.\\nWhile she said that she would not “be pigeonholed” by the party switch, the\\xa0dual\\xa0Republican supermajorities could significantly ease GOP lawmakers’ efforts to pass more conservative priorities, like new abortion restrictions, without facing the threat of Cooper’s veto.\\nCotham’s party switch was also surprising because of her roots in the Democratic Party. She has spent a collective decade in the North Carolina state House and represents a Democratic-leaning district in the state’s largest metro area. She also comes from a family with a history in Democratic politics.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer mother, Pat Cotham, serves on the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners and is a Democratic National Committee (DNC) member, while her father, John, served as chair of the Mecklenburg Democratic Party.\\xa0\\nMichael Whatley, the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, welcomed Cotham into the GOP on Wednesday, saying that it was proof that Democrats had moved too far to the left.\\n“We are thrilled to have Rep. Cotham join the Republican Party to advance solutions for North Carolina families,” Whatley said in a statement. “This announcement continues to reflect that the Democratic Party is too radical for North Carolina. The values of the Republican Party align with voters, and the People of Mecklenburg County should be proud to have her representation in Raleigh.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\nCotham’s party switch was\\xa0first reported by Axios\\xa0on Tuesday\\xa0before it was formally announced.\\nThe North Carolina Democratic Party reacted furiously to the decision, calling it a “deceit of the highest order” and demanding that she resign from her seat.\\n“Rep. Cotham’s decision is a betrayal to the people of HD-112 with repercussions not only for the people of her district, but for the entire state of North Carolina,” North Carolina Democratic Party Chair Anderson Clayton and Mecklenburg County Democratic Party Chair Jane Whitley said in a joint statement. “If she can no longer represent the values her constituents trusted her to champion, she should resign immediately.”\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  'North Carolina lawmaker Tricia Cotham swaps parties, joins Republicans',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nA North Carolina Democratic state representative announced on Wednesday that she would switch political parties and become a Republican, a move that hands the GOP a veto-proof supermajority in the state House in the middle of the legislative session.\\nState Rep. Tricia Cotham, who represents a Democratic-leaning district in the Charlotte area, formally announced her decision at a\\xa0morning press conference, saying that it was born out of frustration and disagreements with the modern state Democratic Party.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“The party wants to villainize anyone who has free thought, free judgment, has solutions and wants to get to work to better our state,” Cotham said. “Not just sit in a meeting and have a workshop after a workshop, but really work with individuals to get things done.\\n“What happened to the concept of a big tent party?” she later added. “What happened to these ideas that we’re inclusive, we’re tolerant, we’re so welcoming to everybody. No, you’re not.”\\xa0\\nCotham’s decision has massive implications for politics in the state. Republicans came out of the 2022 election cycle winning a supermajority in the state Senate outright, but falling one seat short of a supermajority in the state House.\\xa0\\nCotham’s party switch virtually ensures that Democratic state lawmakers won’t be able to uphold Gov. Roy Cooper’s (D) vetoes, so long as all members are voting.\\nWhile she said that she would not “be pigeonholed” by the party switch, the\\xa0dual\\xa0Republican supermajorities could significantly ease GOP lawmakers’ efforts to pass more conservative priorities, like new abortion restrictions, without facing the threat of Cooper’s veto.\\nCotham’s party switch was also surprising because of her roots in the Democratic Party. She has spent a collective decade in the North Carolina state House and represents a Democratic-leaning district in the state’s largest metro area. She also comes from a family with a history in Democratic politics.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHer mother, Pat Cotham, serves on the Mecklenburg Board of County Commissioners and is a Democratic National Committee (DNC) member, while her father, John, served as chair of the Mecklenburg Democratic Party.\\xa0\\nMichael Whatley, the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party, welcomed Cotham into the GOP on Wednesday, saying that it was proof that Democrats had moved too far to the left.\\n“We are thrilled to have Rep.

       "  '\\n\\nCNN host Don Lemon, one of the most recognizable personalities across the cable news business, has a history of making offensive remarks to and threatening female staffers who anger him, according to a new report. \\nVariety published an extensive exposé this week on Lemon’s conduct relating to women, alleging a pattern of abusive and threatening behavior by the former prime-time anchor, who currently hosts CNN’s revamped morning program along with Kaitlan Collins and Poppy Harlow. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe report alleges that, among other incidents, while Lemon was anchoring CNN’s “Live From” program in 2008, he became angry when he was passed over for a reporting assignment for Kyra Phillips, who has since left the network. \\nCiting unnamed sources at the network at the time, Variety reported Phillips received two threatening text messages from an unknown sender after she was granted the reporting mission that said, “Now you’ve crossed the line, and you’re going to pay for it.”\\nThe texts were eventually traced by network leadership back to Lemon, the outlet reported. \\n“Don says the alleged incident never occurred and that he was never notified of any investigation,”  a spokesperson for the network told Variety. “CNN cannot corroborate the alleged events from 15 years ago.” \\nIn a separate statement to The Hill, a CNN spokesperson called Variety’s reporting “reckless.”\\xa0\\n“The story, which is riddled with patently false anecdotes and no concrete evidence, is entirely based on unsourced, unsubstantiated, 15-year-old anonymous gossip,” the spokesperson said. “It’s amazing and disappointing that Variety would be so reckless.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tIRS to release plans for spending $80-billion funding boost\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tChinese Embassy warns lawmakers against meeting with Taiwan president\\t\\n\\nLemon’s comments about women have come under scrutiny in recent weeks after he was widely admonished by critics inside and outside of the network for remarks he made about Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley shortly after she announced a bid for the White House. \\n“Nikki Haley isn’t in her prime, sorry. A woman is considered to be in their prime in 20s and 30s and maybe 40s,” Lemon said on the air earlier this year, a quip that earned him an internal rebuke from network president Chris Licht and calls from women’s rights groups to have him fired. \\n“A woman’s age doesn’t define her either personally or professionally,” Lemon wrote on Twitter as part of an apology for the remark about Haley. “I have countless women in my life who prove that every day.”\\n\\n'),\n",

Still, they telegraphed how the former president plans to make his various legal entanglements a central part of his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.\\nSince winning the White House in 2016, Trump has sought to cast himself as the target of a so-called deep state intent on weeding out anyone whom it sees as a threat to its power. During his time in Washington, he faced impeachment twice.\\xa0\\nYet while Republicans have rallied around him amid his indictment in New York, many have urged the party, both publicly and privately, to move on to a new standard-bearer without Trump’s political and legal baggage.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFlorida Gov.

And now these radical left lunatics want to interfere with our elections by using law enforcement.

Skyrocketing interest rates pushed the average monthly car payment on a five-year loan to $723 in March.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nNew vehicles priced under $25,000, a range that the average American might deem affordable, now account for less than 5 percent of all sales.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers who walk onto a dealer’s lot expecting such enticements as zero-APR financing and thousand-dollar rebates are in for a surprise: For the first time in recent memory, the automobile industry is a seller’s market.\\xa0\\n“It is no longer a $25,000, $30,000 transaction. It is a $50,000, $60,000 transaction,” said Patrick Rosenberg, director of automotive finance intelligence at J.D. Power, a data and analytics company that researches the automotive sector. “It is a greater financial commitment than it has ever been.”\\xa0\\nThe car-and-truck marketplace went haywire during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with much of the American economy. A global shortage in semiconductors, the chips that control everything from airbags to windshield wipers, seeded massive production delays. Toss in pandemic shutdowns and other supply-chain kinks, and the conveyor belt of new cars slowed to a crawl.\\xa0\\nAt that point, simple economics kicked in. Demand overwhelmed supply. The customer-friendly, let’s-make-a-deal milieu of the typical new-car dealership vanished as quickly as that new-car smell. It hasn’t returned.\\xa0\\nGenerations of automotive customers have come to expect deep discounts, four-figure rebates and zero-interest financing. In a new-car negotiation, the sticker price was a mere starting point. No longer.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Most people don’t expect to pay sticker price. People are paying sticker price,” said Jessica Caldwell, executive director of insights at Edmunds, the automotive information-services company. “Vehicles are coming off the truck, and they’re being sold immediately.”\\xa0\\nThe semiconductor crisis has eased, the supply chain has loosened, and vehicle production has resumed. But most of the cars and trucks rolling off the assembly lines are luxury items.\\xa0\\nBetween December 2017 and December 2022, the share of all new auto sales priced above $60,000 more than tripled, from 8 percent to 25 percent, according to research by Cox Automotive.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn the same five years, the share of sales under $25,000, a standard cutoff for economy vehicles, shrank from 13 percent to 4 percent.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“The manufacturers have been steering the market toward more expensive products,” said Charlie Chesbrough, senior economist at Cox. “All those bells and whistles, nav-screens, cruise control, all those fantastic and lifesaving technologies cost money.”\\xa0\\nMore than 90 vehicle models now fetch $60,000 or more, Cox reports. Meanwhile, in five years, the number of models priced under $25,000 has dwindled from 36 to 10.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nU.S. automakers have walked away from economy-priced sedans because of thin profit margins and because consumers don’t seem to want them.\\xa0\\n“Ford Focus, Ford Fusion, Chevy Malibu, Chevy Cavalier: There’s a long history of the Detroit three making passenger cars,” Chesbrough said. “But they decided, seven, eight years ago, that the margins just weren’t there for them.”\\xa0\\nAs a result, actual cars now make up only about one-fifth of the Detroit auto market, an industry dominated by high-priced pickups and SUVs.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nA $60,000 vehicle costs more money than the average American earns in a year. Yet, car-buyers bear some blame for inflating new-car prices.\\xa0\\nCar prices are rising so steeply, in part, because car buyers are loading up on options: upscale sound systems, sunroofs, leather seats and navigation systems that know your destination before you have chosen it. A “fully loaded” vehicle can cost twice as much as its “base price” counterpart.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nAutomakers make a lot more profit on luxury cars than on value-priced sedans. They are happy to help car-buyers option up.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“People are not pragmatic when it comes to car-buying,” Caldwell said. “They get very emotional.”\\xa0\\nThey may get more emotional when the invoice arrives.\\xa0\\xa0\\nInterest rates on new-car loans have soared from 4 or 5 percent to “almost 7 percent” in the past year, Caldwell said. Between high sticker prices and brutal interest rates, more than 15 percent of new-car buyers now shell out more than $1,000 in monthly loan payments. Not on their house: on their car.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“It’s pricing a lot of people out of the market,” Rosenberg said. Some buyers are resorting to loans with ever-longer terms of six, seven or even eight years. Longer loans yield lower monthly payments, but at progressively higher interest rates.\\xa0\\nBuyers with low incomes and weak credit are fleeing the new-car market. Some of them wind up on the used-car market, where the pickings are not much better.\\xa0\\nUsed car prices rose by more than half between mid-2020 and early 2022, the market’s peak. Prices have eased, but the average used car still costs upwards of $26,000.\\xa0\\nTo find a used vehicle priced at $20,000 or less, a standard benchmark for affordability, a buyer may have to settle for an older, high-mileage vehicle, and those are in short supply.\\xa0\\nNot surprisingly, many consumers are holding onto their cars. The average age of U.S. cars will hit 12.3 years in 2023 by one projection — an all-time high. It’s not a bad time to be an auto mechanic.\\xa0\\nIndustry analysts wonder, though, how long all of those aging vehicles can hold out.\\xa0\\n“I do think there’s going to be a reckoning for this country at some point,” Chesbrough said. “We’re just not going to have enough personal transportation available.”\\xa0\\nSurprisingly, the drop-off in customers hasn’t hurt automakers, at least not yet.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“We actually sold more than 3 million fewer vehicles in 2022 than in 2019,” Chesbrough said. “But revenue was $15 billion higher, because the prices were so much higher.”\\xa0\\nBut automakers aren’t necessarily happy with the current state of the new-car marketplace. They would rather have more inventory, analysts say, enough cars to restore the delicate equilibrium of supply and demand. The seller’s market has not gone over particularly well with buyers.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“I think consumers have been mad,” said Caldwell, of Edmunds. “Even customers who have a lot of money are looking at interest rates and saying, ‘Why would I do this?’”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIf you plan to buy a new car, despite all of the aforementioned perils, then here are some tips from a pro.\\xa0\\n“I think consumers need to be their own advocate,” Rosenberg said. “They need to do research. They need to set themselves a budget. And they need to make an informed decision, and not an emotional decision.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“You’re talking about six-, seven-year loans in excess of $700 in [monthly] payments. What makes sense to me financially? What can I handle? And it’s hard to do, because there are some great vehicles out there, with a lot of extras.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tIRS to release plans for spending $80 billion funding boost\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tLack of new home listings weakens mortgage demand\\t\\n\\nAnd here is some counsel from Benjamin Preston, autos reporter at Consumer Reports: “If you’re looking for a car, it has never been more important to research alternatives and cast a wider net to maybe find something outside your immediate locale.”\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn the current climate, Preston said, “it’s a good idea to pick a car that you won’t mind hanging onto for a while.”\\xa0\\n—Updated at 10:31 a.m.\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nAt some point in the not-too-distant past, a new car became a luxury purchase.\\xa0\\nThe average price for a new vehicle hit $49,500 at the end of last year, compared to $38,948 just three years earlier. Skyrocketing interest rates pushed the average monthly car payment on a five-year loan to $723 in March.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nNew vehicles priced under $25,000, a range that the average American might deem affordable, now account for less than 5 percent of all sales.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\nCustomers who walk onto a dealer’s lot expecting such enticements as zero-APR financing and thousand-dollar rebates are in for a surprise: For the first time in recent memory, the automobile industry is a seller’s market.\\xa0\\n“It is no longer a $25,000, $30,000 transaction. It is a $50,000, $60,000 transaction,” said Patrick Rosenberg, director of automotive finance intelligence at J.D. Power, a data and analytics company that researches the automotive sector. “It is a greater financial commitment than it has ever been.”\\xa0\\nThe car-and-truck marketplace went haywire during the COVID-19 pandemic, along with much of the American economy. A global shortage in semiconductors, the chips that control everything from airbags to windshield wipers, seeded massive production delays. Toss in pandemic shutdowns and other supply-chain kinks, and the conveyor belt of new cars slowed to a crawl.\\xa0\\nAt that point, simple economics kicked in. Demand overwhelmed supply. The customer-friendly, let’s-make-a-deal milieu of the typical new-car dealership vanished as quickly as that new-car smell. It hasn’t returned.\\xa0\\nGenerations of automotive customers have come to expect deep discounts, four-figure rebates and zero-interest financing. In a new-car negotiation, the sticker price was a mere starting point. No longer.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Most people don’t expect to pay sticker price.

The participants ranged from 40 to 65 years old.\\xa0\\nThe participants answered questions and gave blood samples in the summer of 2020, following the first lockdown.\\xa0They did the same in the spring of 2021, right after COVID-19 vaccinations began.\\xa0\\nAll participants received one or two doses of the main vaccines offered in Spain at the time: AstraZeneca, Pfizer or Moderna.\\xa0\\xa0Effects on spike proteins: The researchers then measured the responses of three antibodies to five viral antigens — three of which are located on the spike protein contained in the vaccine.\\xa0\\n\\xa0\\xa0They estimated exposure to fine particulate matter, black carbon, nitrogen dioxide and ozone for participants based on their addresses prior to the pandemic.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Short- and long-term immune impacts: The authors found that pre-pandemic exposure to the first three pollutants in uninfected individuals was associated with a 5 to 10 percent reduction in vaccine-induced spike antibodies.\\nThey observed a decrease in antibodies for both IgM — an indicator of short-term immunity — and IgG, which demonstrates longer-term resilience.\\xa0\\xa0\\nHowever, the researchers identified an inverse association for IgG, another antibody, with respect to ozone exposure.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nPersistent pollution problems: “Air pollution can induce chronic inflammation, which has been associated with a negative effect on vaccine efficacy,” co-senior author Carlota Dobaño, said in a statement.\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Our findings are consistent with evidence that persistent organic pollutants reduce vaccine responses in children,” Dobaño added.\\xa0?\\nOn Our Radar\\xa0\\nUpcoming news themes and events we’re watching:\\n\\n\\nThe California Department of Water Resources will hold a Tribal Water Summit Film Festival on Wednesday, April 12, in Sacramento.

       "  '\\n\\nMaryland’s Attorney General on Wednesday released a report accusing Catholic priests and others at the Archdiocese of Baltimore of decades of sexual abuse against more than 600 children, following a multi-year grand jury investigation.\\n“The incontrovertible history uncovered by this investigation is one of pervasive and persistent abuse by priests and other Archdiocese personnel,” a 463-page redacted report, released by Attorney General Anthony Brown, said. “It is also a history of repeated dismissal or cover up of that abuse by the Catholic Church hierarchy.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nInvestigators interviewed hundreds of victims and witnesses whose stories “reveal themes and behaviors typical of adults who sexually abuse children, and of those who enable abuse by concealing it,” according to the report.\\xa0\\n“What was consistent throughout was the absolute authority and power these abusive priests and church leadership held over victims, their families, and their communities,” it continued. \\xa0\\nThe investigation found more than 600 children were abused by 156 people but determined the actual number is “likely far higher.” \\nMany of the accused are now dead and no longer able to be prosecuted, notes the report — which focuses mainly on alleged abuse from the 1940s through 2002. The investigators said they hope exposing the issues will bring accountability in the absence of criminal justice.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nThe report names 146 abusers — including priests, deacons, sisters and other personnel — and redacted the names of an additional 10.\\n“The staggering pervasiveness of the abuse itself underscores the culpability of the Church hierarchy,” the report reads. “The sheer number of abusers and victims, the depravity of the abusers’ conduct, and the frequency with which known abusers were given the opportunity to continue preying upon children are astonishing.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tIRS to release plans for spending $80 billion funding boost\\t\\n\\nBaltimore Archbishop William E.

Ron DeSantis (R) for president on Wednesday, becoming the second House Republican to throw their support behind the Florida governor — even though he has not launched a campaign for the White House.\\nIn a statement released by the Never Back Down super PAC, which is supporting a DeSantis presidential bid, Massie called the Florida governor “a proven energetic leader.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“America needs a leader who is decisive, respects the Constitution, understands policy, puts family first, and leads by inspiring,” Massie said. “That’s why I’m endorsing Ron DeSantis for President.”\\n“If we make the right choices, America’s best days are in front of us. Let’s pick a proven energetic leader who can get us there,” he continued. “Let’s choose Ron DeSantis for President.”\\nMassie follows Rep. Chip Roy (R-Texas) in endorsing DeSantis ahead of his widely expected 2024 campaign announcement.\\nDeSantis has said he will make a decision on a presidential run after Florida’s legislative session ends in May. In the meantime, however, he has embarked on a book tour that has brought him to pivotal primary states, including Iowa.\\nWhile Roy and Massie are the only House Republicans to formally throw their support behind DeSantis at this point, other GOP lawmakers have waded into the primary in support of former President Trump and former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R). A number of Trump’s closest congressional allies have already endorsed him, and Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) has said he is supporting Haley.\\nMassie’s endorsement comes one day after Trump, the current 2024 GOP frontrunner, pleaded not guilty to 34 felony counts in New York for his alleged role in organizing hush money payments to an adult film star in the lead-up to the 2016 presidential election. He is the first current or former president to be arraigned on criminal charges.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe Kentucky Republican has had a rocky relationship with Trump in the past. In 2020, Trump labeled Massie a “grandstander” and called for him to be ousted from the Republican party after he tried to hold up a COVID-19 relief package. Congress ultimately passed the bill, which was signed into law.\\nTwo years later, Trump endorsed Massie for reelection despite the previous dust up, and the congressman went on to win another two years in office.\\nIn his statement, Massie pointed to DeSantis’s record as both a congressman and the governor of Florida, highlighting his stances on economic freedom and “putting America first.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\n“I’ve been honored to call Ron DeSantis a friend for over a decade,” Massie said. “During the six years we served together in Congress, I witnessed Ron fight for economic freedom, personal liberty, fiscal responsibility, and constitutionally limited government.”\\n“In his congressional office and as Governor, Ron has always surrounded himself with capable people who share his principles,” he continued. “Ron knows that putting America first means putting Americans first, not corporations, and he’s never backed down from a fight with the big guys in pharma, agriculture, and tech.”\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  'Tim Scott gets Senate GOP nudge for 2024 bid | The Hill',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nSen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) is finding success wooing his Senate GOP colleagues to his side for a possible 2024 presidential run, with a number of his fellow senators personally encouraging him to get in the race.\\xa0\\nOf roughly a dozen Senate Republicans The Hill interviewed, three — Sens. John Thune (S.D.), Mike Rounds (S.D.) and John Cornyn (Texas) — said they have outright encouraged Scott to run for the White House, while two others — Sens. Kevin Cramer (N.D.) and Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.) said they’ve talked with him behind closed doors about his potential run. Almost every other senator spoke glowingly of the South Carolina Republican and indicated they hope he runs or believe he would make a top-level candidate.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think he’d be a great candidate. I’m excited about it. I’ve been encouraging him,” Thune told The Hill. “I think he’s getting a lot of encouragement from his colleagues. He’s really well thought of and respected and I think he’d be a really interesting candidate for president, and in a field that kind of could be fairly open.”\\n“[I] told him to let me know when he wants to come to Northwest Iowa. It’s right next to South Dakota and I tell him I’ll come out for him or against him — whichever helps him the most,” Thune said with a laugh.\\nScott is considered an influential member of the chamber on a number of subjects, including on financial matters as ranking member on the Senate Banking Committee and on criminal justice and policing. Multiple senators also lauded his leadership qualities and believe that his voice would be particularly resonant now.\\xa0\\nAlong with Thune, Rounds is one of Scott’s biggest cheerleaders in the upper chamber and says he will back him if he launches a bid.\\xa0\\n“Tim has got a great personal story. His background shows he’ll work very, very hard. … He cares about other people, and he has a tendency to bring in a circle of friends and advisers that he can depend on, but give him good advice,” Rounds said in a brief interview. “I’ve simply offered to him that I would really look forward to seeing him toss his hat into the right.”\\nScott on Tuesday gave the latest hint of what’s to come as he announced plans to visit Iowa, New Hampshire and his home state of South Carolina next week. The plans come on the heels of other 2024 maneuvers for Scott, who has hired staff and appeared at a number of related events last month, including the Palmetto Family Council forum and the American Enterprise Institute’s annual summit in Sea Island, Ga.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think he’d be a terrific president,” said Sen. John Barrasso (Wyo.), the No. 3 Senate Republican. “To me, he’s Ronald Reagan, morning in America, optimistic, the country of opportunity.”\\nA source familiar with Scott told The Hill that he is nearing a decision on 2024 plans.\\xa0\\nScott is also highly thought of by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), having been the GOP’s lead negotiator on policing reform and one of the foremost figures involved in the 2017 tax reform package. One GOP strategist close to McConnell said that the leader “thinks the world of Tim Scott and would certainly wish him the best in whatever he wants to do.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe main question surrounding Scott remains his chances at making a dent in the 2024 field and whether his “happy warrior” mentality is a fit at a time when anger remains prevalent throughout the GOP base. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), a friend of Scott’s, believes that his chances could hinge on that issue.\\xa0\\n“Americans always want change — always.

       "  'IRS to release plans for spending $80 billion funding boost | The Hill',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nThe tax world is getting ready for a detailed IRS breakdown of how it plans to spend the $80 billion it was awarded in Democrats’ Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed last year.\\nThe $80 billion will be spent over the next 10 years and represents the most substantial funding boost for the federal tax collection agency in decades. The IRA breaks the money down into four main categories: $25.3 billion for operations, $3.1 billion to help answer the phones, $4.8 billion for new technology, and a whopping $45.6 billion for enforcement and audits.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nGet those taxes in: IRS funding boost sets high hopes for smoother tax filing season\\xa0\\nBeyond those general allotments, it’s up to the IRS and the Treasury Department to spell out exactly how that money will be spent. Those more detailed designations will be made public Thursday afternoon, according to two Washington, D.C., tax experts briefed on the plans.\\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Tuesday during the swearing-in of new IRS commissioner Danny Werfel that the plan would be unveiled this week and repeated a promise that audit rates wouldn’t be going up for people making under $400,000 a year despite all the new money for audits.\\n“These additional resources will help us peel back complex corporate structures and large taxpaying entities — and make sure that they pay what they owe. As I’ve said before, I have directed that these resources will not be used to increase the audit rate for small businesses and households making under $400,000 a year, relative to historical levels,” Yellen said Tuesday.\\nThere has been some notable criticism of how the new money for the IRS was broken down in the IRA. Critics of the funding boost say too much of it is going to audits as opposed to basic taxpayer services and new technology, which has been outdated for years.\\n“The IRA allocated the funds in a manner that does not address the needs of U.S. taxpayers, including individuals, families, and businesses,” the National Taxpayer Advocate, the office at the IRS that tries to influence policy on behalf of workers and families as opposed to big business, wrote in blog post earlier this month.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nSecond thoughts: Taxpayer advocate urges Congress to reconsider $80 billion IRS funding boost\\n“It’s a no-brainer that the areas that require improvement most urgently are taxpayer service and technology. And if the IRS would provide timely and clear guidance, more transparency, and more front-end services in a proactive manner, it could reduce back-end enforcement needs,” advocate Erin Collins wrote.\\nLawmakers and officials have justified the new money for enforcement by pointing to the “tax gap,” which is the amount of money that the government is owed each year but does not collect.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThat was about $470 billion a year between 2017 and 2019, the IRS recently projected, or roughly 2.4 percent of total U.S. production. The tax gap is measured retroactively and the latest hard numbers are for the years 2014 to 2016, when it averaged $428 billion a year.\\nAlmost all of the tax gap is due to people and businesses underreporting their income to the government, but the largest segment comes from individual business income at $130 billion per year. Those are businesses that typically have legal designations as S-corps, partnerships and LLCs.\\nLarge corporations fail to pay $23 billion per year while small corporations come up short $14 billion annually.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nWith the release of the plan on Thursday, much attention will be paid to how it will be able to reduce the tax gap while still keeping the Biden administration’s pledge of keeping audit rates for people making under $400,000 a year unchanged.\\nComing soon? Here’s what a free IRS e-filing tax return system could look like\\nAudit rates have been falling across the board for the last decade. While high earners are audited at higher rates than lower earners, high earners have seen their audit rates decrease more rapidly in recent years than people earning less money, a 2022 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\nTaxpayers making more than $10 million a year had a 21.2 percent chance of being audited in 2010 and just a 3.9 percent chance of being audited in 2019. Taxpayers making between $5 million and $10 million had a 13.5 percent chance of being audited in 2010 and a 1.4 percent chance of being audited in 2010, according to the GAO.\\nFor taxpayers making between $50,000 and $75,000, their audit rates fell from a 0.7 percent chance in 2010 to a 0.1 percent chance in 2019.\\nMedian household income in the U.S. was $70,784 in 2021, basically unchanged from 2020. Income inequality as measured according to the Gini Index increased by 1.2 percent between 2020 and 2021, Census Department data shows.\\n\\n'),\n",

Critics of the funding boost say too much of it is going to audits as opposed to basic taxpayer services and new technology, which has been outdated for years.\\n“The IRA allocated the funds in a manner that does not address the needs of U.S. taxpayers, including individuals, families, and businesses,” the National Taxpayer Advocate, the office at the IRS that tries to influence policy on behalf of workers and families as opposed to big business, wrote in blog post earlier this month.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nSecond thoughts: Taxpayer advocate urges Congress to reconsider $80 billion IRS funding boost\\n“It’s a no-brainer that the areas that require improvement most urgently are taxpayer service and technology. And if the IRS would provide timely and clear guidance, more transparency, and more front-end services in a proactive manner, it could reduce back-end enforcement needs,” advocate Erin Collins wrote.\\nLawmakers and officials have justified the new money for enforcement by pointing to the “tax gap,” which is the amount of money that the government is owed each year but does not collect.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThat was about $470 billion a year between 2017 and 2019, the IRS recently projected, or roughly 2.4 percent of total U.S. production. The tax gap is measured retroactively and the latest hard numbers are for the years 2014 to 2016, when it averaged $428 billion a year.\\nAlmost all of the tax gap is due to people and businesses underreporting their income to the government, but the largest segment comes from individual business income at $130 billion per year. Those are businesses that typically have legal designations as S-corps, partnerships and LLCs.\\nLarge corporations fail to pay $23 billion per year while small corporations come up short $14 billion annually.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nWith the release of the plan on Thursday, much attention will be paid to how it will be able to reduce the tax gap while still keeping the Biden administration’s pledge of keeping audit rates for people making under $400,000 a year unchanged.\\nComing soon? Here’s what a free IRS e-filing tax return system could look like\\nAudit rates have been falling across the board for the last decade. While high earners are audited at higher rates than lower earners, high earners have seen their audit rates decrease more rapidly in recent years than people earning less money, a 2022 study by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\nTaxpayers making more than $10 million a year had a 21.2 percent chance of being audited in 2010 and just a 3.9 percent chance of being audited in 2019. Taxpayers making between $5 million and $10 million had a 13.5 percent chance of being audited in 2010 and a 1.4 percent chance of being audited in 2010, according to the GAO.\\nFor taxpayers making between $50,000 and $75,000, their audit rates fell from a 0.7 percent chance in 2010 to a 0.1 percent chance in 2019.\\nMedian household income in the U.S. was $70,784 in 2021, basically unchanged from 2020. Income inequality as measured according to the Gini Index increased by 1.2 percent between 2020 and 2021, Census Department data shows.\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nThe Biden administration will put nearly $600 million toward drought resilience and upgrades to water infrastructure, Interior Department officials announced Wednesday.\\nThe administration will disperse nearly $585 million in funding from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to 83 water projects in 11 states, Deputy Interior Secretary Tommy Beaudreau said on a call with reporters.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nEvery major river basin under the Bureau of Reclamation’s (BOR) jurisdiction is represented in the projects selected, according to the Interior Department, with funding going to Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, New Mexico, Nevada, Oregon, South Dakota and Washington projects.\\nThe projects include those aimed at improving water treatment infrastructure for tribal nations, upgrading hydropower equipment and project buildings, and replacing aging components. The largest single award will go to California’s Central Valley, set to receive $65.9 million to modernize the Trinity River Fish Hatchery, where building infrastructure has remained in continuous use for six decades. This includes funds to replace corroded piping, upgrade the filtration system and install a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition system.\\nBeaudreau, speaking from the Imperial Dam on the California/Arizona border, presented the funds as part of ongoing efforts by the federal government to address the two-decade drought that has taken a toll on the west in general and the states in the Colorado River Basin in particular.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tChinese Embassy warns lawmakers against meeting with Taiwan president\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tBlack women have disproportionately high maternal death rate regardless of local risk: study\\t\\n\\n“Right now even with this winter snowpack and rainfall, most of the American West, including the Colorado River basin, is in the midst of a 23-year drought,” he said. “By working together I’m confident we can provide much-needed relief to communities across the West[.]”\\nInfrastructure legislation passed under the Biden administration has put just under $13 billion toward drought resilience and water infrastructure. This includes $4.6 billion from the Inflation Reduction Act and $8.3 billion from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for BOR projects, which the administration has collectively touted as the largest government investment in drought resilience in U.S. history.\\nThe Interior Department previously allocated $240 million for water infrastructure upgrades through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law for fiscal 2022.\\n\\n'),\n",

Eric Holcomb (R) signed the bill that saw his state join at least 12 others that have restricted or banned such care.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nBut the lawsuit filed by the ACLU on behalf of four transgender youth, a doctor and a health care clinic alleges that the new law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment and federal Medicaid and Affordable Care Act requirements by prohibiting care that would otherwise be authorized and reimbursed by the federal government programs.\\nThe 47-page lawsuit asks the court to find the law unconstitutional and asks for it to block the state from enforcing the measures.\\xa0\\nThe bill that blocks people under the age of 18 from accessing hormone therapies, puberty blockers and gender-affirming surgeries in the state was signed just a day after Holcomb criticized the legislation as being “as clear as mud.”\\n“It wasn’t part of my agenda,” Holcomb told reporters Tuesday. “I’ve told some people very close to me: This is clear as mud. There’s some vagueness to it. So I want to make sure I completely understand.”\\nBut after signing the bill on Wednesday, Holcomb said in a statement that gender-affirming surgeries should happen “as an adult.”\\n“Permanent gender-changing surgeries with lifelong impacts and medically prescribed preparation for such a transition should occur as an adult, not as a minor,” the statement said.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tPelosi offers McCarthy rare praise after his meeting with Taiwan president\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\nBut ACLU leaders said the bill would have “devastating” effects for minors seeking such care.\\n“This law would be devastating to trans youth and their families, causing them serious injuries and forcing those who can to uproot their lives and leave the state to access the gender-affirming care they need,” Ken Falk, ACLU of Indiana legal director, said in a statement.\\nAn ACLU spokesperson said on Twitter that the Indiana lawsuit was the first of eight different suits the group plans to file on new bans on youth transgender care in the coming weeks. That includes suits in Oklahoma, Kentucky, Tennessee and more.\\n\\n'),\n",

Many top academics and researchers have expressed concerns that there is about a\\xa010 percent\\xa0or greater chance of human extinction due to future advanced AI systems.\\nBut long before that, the demographic group expected to be impacted the most is the global workforce.\\xa0\\nVarious\\xa0organizations\\xa0and workers, especially those with\\xa0white-collar jobs, have expressed concerns that AI may cause severe job disruption, making many of their activities obsolete and taking over their jobs.\\xa0\\nRecent research indicates that AI could affect the work tasks of approximately\\xa080 percent\\xa0of the U.S. workforce; about\\xa0166 million\\xa0men and women. Also, one\\xa0survey\\xa0reported that\\xa062 percent\\xa0of job seekers said they were concerned that AI could derail their careers.\\nThis comes during a time when demographic and economic headwinds are transforming the labor force.\\xa0More than 50 percent\\xa0of U.S. adults age 55 and older said they had retired due to COVID in a 2021 Pew Research Center survey. More recently, record inflation has forced many others to reconsider their plans, with\\xa040 percent\\xa0of workers over 45 reportedly expecting to delay retirement due to increased expenses. Additionally, many women working lower-income jobs without college degrees are still recovering from\\xa0COVID layoffs\\xa0that heavily impacted their sectors. Reportedly,\\xa01.6 million\\xa0fewer women were in the workforce in January than there were in February 2020.\\xa0\\nIt’s clear, now more than ever, that Americans still need to work. However, recent research estimates that generative AI could automate a quarter of the work done in the U.S. One generative\\xa0AI model,\\xa0ChatGPT, had more than\\xa01 million\\xa0users in just five days after its launch in November and now has\\xa025 million\\xa0people using it daily. As generative AI contributes to labor cost savings, adds new jobs and increases productivity, it is raising the chances of a\\xa0productivity boom, but could also raise the chances of a labor crisis.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThat said, many of the darkest predictions about generative AI may be overblown.\\xa0Considering all that human intelligence has already done to the planet’s climate, environment, wildlife, natural resources\\xa0and\\xa0the impact of pollution, it’s difficult to imagine how artificial intelligence could do worse with respect to the survival of the world’s\\xa08 billion\\xa0human inhabitants.\\nGiven America’s\\xa0dismal record\\xa0in addressing global warming, biodiversity loss, environmental degradation and other major\\xa0problems\\xa0facing the country, it’s difficult to see how the U.S. will be able to control the development of\\xa0AI systems with human-competitive intelligence that could pose profound risks to society and humanity.\\xa0Open letters to governments in the recent past from\\xa0thousands\\xa0of scientists warning of untold suffering and declaring a\\xa0climate emergency\\xa0have had relatively little effect on America’s policies. This isn’t a great sign for the potential impact of the AGI open letter.\\xa0\\nBut lawmakers are paying attention. Two years ago, Congress created a new government office,\\xa0The White House AI Initiative Office,\\xa0to coordinate AI research across government agencies and direct an interagency task force to develop a strategic plan with research priorities, ethical concerns and environmental issues.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tAchieving true environmental justice requires moving beyond the rhetoric\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tCongresswoman Pat Schroeder, a brief reminiscence\\t\\n\\nAt the start of this year, the National Artificial Intelligence Research Task Force (NAIRR) presented its\\xa0final report\\xa0to the president and members of Congress. That report provides a roadmap for establishing a national research infrastructure that would broaden access to the resources essential to AI research and development.\\nAs the U.S. government encourages further AI development by the private sector, it’s clear that there’s no turning back on the technology. What is not at all clear is whether America will be able to control its rapid evolution.\\xa0\\nJoseph Chamie is a consulting demographer, a former director of the United Nations Population Division and author of numerous publications on population issues, including his recent book,\\xa0“Population Levels, Trends, and Differentials.”\\n\\n'),\n",

But even the addition of the six newcomers brought the number of women in the House to just 16, a tiny percentage of the total House membership of four 435.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAlthough we came from opposite sides of the country, Pat and I found much common ground. We were both Harvard Law graduates (although she was a year ahead of me), strong opponents of the Vietnam War and elected because the Democratic Party’s powers-that-be never thought either of us, as women, could, or possibly even should, win. But despite the odds, both of us did. \\xa0\\xa0\\nAt that time, women were generally treated as second-class citizens, a fact that the Congresswomen fought against mightily. The House itself was part of the problem. Not only did it fail to welcome us with open arms, but it actively discriminated.

Another: As a woman, Pat was given only a half a seat on the Armed Services Committee that she shared with a Black man whom the committee chair also viewed as less than a full person. But none of these obstacles intimidated Pat or the rest of us.\\nWhen we served together, Pat took on the task of ending the exclusion of women from the U.S. military academies. She also authored vital legislation to prevent the firing or discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace because of their pregnancy. Pat wasn’t alone. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) finally won Social Security coverage for domestic workers, a decades-long struggle. Lindy Boggs (D-La.) and Barbara Mikulski (d-Md.) got the first legislation adopted to combat domestic violence.

I authored a law that stopped the humiliation of rape victims when they testified in federal trials. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 1977, to maximize our clout, the Congresswomen decided to band together and form the Congresswomen’s Caucus, later known as the Congressional Caucus on Women’s Issues. It was bipartisan, with one Democratic and one Republican woman serving as co-chairs. I was very glad that Pat succeeded me as the Democratic co-chair, a position she held for many years. This was a testament to her colleagues’ enormous respect for her wise and effective leadership. Huge progress was made for women’s rights under her guidance. The Caucus survives today, almost 50 years after its creation, because of the solid foundation that Pat constructed. \\xa0\\nFun and fearless — that was Pat.\\nI remember a Congressional trip the Congresswomen took to persuade the Cambodian government to allow food to be delivered to tens of thousands of starving refugees massed on the Thai-Cambodian border. State Department officials, who were responsible for shepherding us around, refused to cross the border with us into Cambodia because the U.S. did not recognize the Cambodian government. Although we had no U.S. government protection, Pat wasn’t deterred; she was one of the first to walk across the border, eager to meet with the refugees who desperately wanted to share their plight with us. (And we succeeded in our mission.)\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn 1972, just before Pat and I came to Congress, the House and Senate passed the Equal Rights Amendment. A target of right-wing attacks, it unfortunately failed to get ratified by 38 states before the ratification deadline. It was a very sore point for me, as a woman and a lawyer, that the Constitution did not explicitly recognize equal rights for women, more than half of America’s population.

We had a nice conversation, but I was especially moved by her continuing fierce support for the ERA. Despite the passage of many years — going back at least to 1977 when all the Congresswomen worked to get the ERA’s ratification deadline extended so that the ERA could finally be ratified, she had never given up.\\nIt is an example that should continue to inspire all of us today.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nElizabeth Holtzman served in Congress for four terms as a Democratic representative from New York.

       "  'Congresswoman Pat Schroeder, a brief reminiscence | The Hill',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nPat Schroeder’s election in 1972 brought a brilliant and very liberal woman to the House of Representatives. Everyone soon learned that Pat never shrank from using her sharp wit, incisive intellect, and sense of humor to skewer stupidity, misogyny, and injustice — and to get things done.\\nI was one of the four women elected at the same time as Pat — two others joined us several months later. But even the addition of the six newcomers brought the number of women in the House to just 16, a tiny percentage of the total House membership of four 435.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nAlthough we came from opposite sides of the country, Pat and I found much common ground. We were both Harvard Law graduates (although she was a year ahead of me), strong opponents of the Vietnam War and elected because the Democratic Party’s powers-that-be never thought either of us, as women, could, or possibly even should, win. But despite the odds, both of us did. \\xa0\\xa0\\nAt that time, women were generally treated as second-class citizens, a fact that the Congresswomen fought against mightily. The House itself was part of the problem. Not only did it fail to welcome us with open arms, but it actively discriminated. One stark example: The House gym was open only to Congressmen, while we women were barred. Another: As a woman, Pat was given only a half a seat on the Armed Services Committee that she shared with a Black man whom the committee chair also viewed as less than a full person. But none of these obstacles intimidated Pat or the rest of us.\\nWhen we served together, Pat took on the task of ending the exclusion of women from the U.S. military academies. She also authored vital legislation to prevent the firing or discrimination against pregnant women in the workplace because of their pregnancy. Pat wasn’t alone. Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) finally won Social Security coverage for domestic workers, a decades-long struggle. Lindy Boggs (D-La.) and Barbara Mikulski (d-Md.) got the first legislation adopted to combat domestic violence. Peggy Heckler (R-Mass.) wrote a law barring discrimination against women in banking and credit. I authored a law that stopped the humiliation of rape victims when they testified in federal trials. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\nIn 1977, to maximize our clout, the Congresswomen decided to band together and form the Congresswomen’s Caucus, later known as the Congressional Caucus on Women’s Issues. It was bipartisan, with one Democratic and one Republican woman serving as co-chairs. I was very glad that Pat succeeded me as the Democratic co-chair, a position she held for many years. This was a testament to her colleagues’ enormous respect for her wise and effective leadership. Huge progress was made for women’s rights under her guidance.

       "  '\\n\\nAttorneys met with Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich on Tuesday at the Lefortovo prison in Moscow as the U.S. is pushing to secure the journalist’s release and label him as wrongfully detained.\\nEmma Tucker, the editor-in-chief of the Journal, said in an email update that Gershkovich’s health was good and she was “encouraged” the legal team could visit him.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nTucker said they were pursuing a legal avenue to free Gershkovich, who is being held on charges of espionage, along with other strategies that include talks with U.S. government officials.\\nThe visit comes as the Biden administration is preparing to declare Gershkovich as wrongfully detained, according to CNN, which would open up new resources to secure his release.\\nThe designation, expected to be made in the coming days, follows an internal review of the journalist’s arrest, CNN reported. The State Department’s office of hostage affairs will work on his case once the designation is official.\\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said at a press briefing on Tuesday that the case was a priority for President Biden.\\n“These charges are ridiculous. Evan is not a spy, Evan has never been a spy,” she said. “This is a case that is a priority for the president.”\\nOver the weekend, Secretary of State Antony Blinken called his counterpart in Russia, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, and called for the immediate release of Gershkovich.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nGerskovich, 31, was arrested last week in the city of Yekaterinburg by Russia’s Federal Security Service, the main successor of the Soviet-era KGB. His arrest marks the first detention of a U.S. journalist in Moscow since the Cold War.\\nGershkovich is accused of spying on behalf of the U.S. government to collect a state secret on the military, charges of which the Wall Street Journal has vehemently rejected. More than 30 media outlets and press freedom groups have also called for his immediate release.\\nA statement carried by Tucker and Almar Latour, the CEO of Journal publisher Dow Jones, on Tuesday said Gershkovich “is grateful for the outpouring of support from around the world.” \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tChinese Embassy warns lawmakers against meeting with Taiwan president\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tBlack women have disproportionately high maternal death rate regardless of local risk: study\\t\\n\\n“We stand with Evan and continue to call for his immediate release,” the statement reads. “His imprisonment is wholly unjustified and an attack on a free press. We are doing everything in our power to bring Evan home safely and will not rest until he is reunited with his family.”\\nIn the email update, Tucker said she met with Gershkovich’s family on Sunday, who were “relieved to know we finally have contact with Evan.”\\nGershkovich was stationed with the Journal’s Moscow bureau and had worked for the paper since January 2022, covering the war in Ukraine and other issues. He most recently wrote about Russia’s economic struggles from western sanctions.\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nBestReviews is reader-supported and may earn an affiliate commission.\\xa0Details.\\nWhat you need to stay safe in an emergency\\nLast weekend, tornadoes touched down across a wide range of states. This week, there is a chance for\\xa0more dangerous weather. Areas that used to be relatively free from severe storms are being hit by extreme weather with increasing frequency. No matter where you live, there is a chance you could experience a damaging storm. To be safe, you need to be prepared. Here are some essential items that can help keep you safe in an emergency.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nIn this article:\\xa0Emergency Hand Crank Radio,\\xa0Rechargeable LED Camping Lantern\\xa0and\\xa0Sawyer Products Mini Water Filtration System.\\nWhy is the weather so severe in the US?\\nThere are two primary reasons why experts say the U.S. is leading the world in weather catastrophes: geography and climate change.\\nMost severe weather requires warm, moist air as a catalyst. Since the U.S. is bordered by two oceans and a gulf, there are ample opportunities for the creation of warm, saturated air. Also, atmospheric rivers enter the country from the west carrying an incredible amount of moisture, which cools and results in an abundance of precipitation.\\xa0\\nAnother factor that influences storms is the jet stream. This fast-moving current of air travels in upper levels of the atmosphere, causing changes in wind and pressure that can either transport storms or keep weather conditions, such as a heatwave, stagnant. As a result, the jet stream is responsible for shaping the weather over the U.S.\\nClimate change warms the world, and the hotter the air is, the more moisture it can hold. This fuels the atmosphere with exactly what it needs to create violent storms. As climate change continues, the frequency of severe weather (hurricanes, tornadoes, heatwaves, drought, wildfires, floods, heavy snowstorms and more) will increase.\\nWhat you need to prepare for severe weather\\nAs the likelihood of increasingly intense weather systems continues to rise, there are a few emergency staples you’ll want to keep on hand, no matter where you live.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nEsky Emergency Hand Crank Radio\\nEven if your power goes out, this rechargeable\\xa0emergency radio\\xa0has you covered. You can listen to emergency broadcasts or use it to charge your phone. It even has a built-in LED light. To charge it without electricity, use the solar panel or hand crank.\\nSold by\\xa0Amazon\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\nSHOP NOW\\n\\n\\nLE Rechargeable LED Camping Lantern\\nThis\\xa0lantern flashlight\\xa0has a hook on the bottom so you can hang it upside down to better illuminate the room.

Mortgage rates for non-conforming loans dropped by 5 points from last week to 6.40 percent while\\xa0fixed mortgage rates for jumbo loans exceeding $726,200 increased to 6.36 percent.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Spring has arrived, but the housing market is missing the customary burst in listings and purchase activity that typically mark the season.\\xa0After four weeks of increasing purchase application activity, volume declined a bit this week even with another small drop in mortgage rates,” MBA chief economist Mike Fratantoni said.\\xa0\\nRecent data from Black Knight revealed that housing inventory remains a challenge, declining for the fifth-consecutive month to its lowest point since May 2022. \\xa0\\nRising costs: Home prices are soaring — so what does that mean for buyers?\\n“New listings – already trending well below pre-pandemic levels for months – ran 27% below those levels in February as potential home sellers continued to shy away from the market,” Black Knight Vice President of Enterprise Research Andy Walden\\xa0said in a statement.\\xa0\\nFratantoni noted that entry level loan purchase applications also declined\\xa0last week, adding that affordability could be an issue\\xa0for first-time buyers.\\xa0\\n“We do expect strong demand from first-time homebuyers over the next several years given the large number of millennials hitting peak first-time homebuyer age, but affordability remains a real challenge in this environment,” Fratantoni said.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tPrivate payrolls below expectations at 145K in March\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFormer Sen. Roy Blunt joins DC lobbying firm\\xa0\\t\\n\\nA recent report from the National Association of Realtors (NAR) shows that older generations hold an edge over their younger counterparts, making up 39 percent of the purchase market in 2022. The share of millennial buyers fell to 28 percent from 41 percent in 2021.\\xa0\\n“Baby boomers have the upper hand in the homebuying market,” Jessica Lautz, NAR’s deputy chief economist and vice president of research, said in a statement.\\xa0\\n“The majority of them are repeat buyers who have housing equity to propel them into their dream home – be it a place to enjoy retirement or a home near friends and family. They are living healthier and longer and making housing trades later in life,” she added.\\xa0\\n\\n'),\n",

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) on Wednesday joined Husch Blackwell Strategies, a Washington, D.C., lobbying firm with close ties to the veteran GOP senator.\\xa0\\xa0\\nBlunt will lead a newly launched strategic advisory practice at the firm, which is run by Gregg Hartley, Blunt’s former chief of staff in the House, and Andy Blunt, his son. Blunt will also reunite with Stacy McBride, his chief of staff in the Senate who joined the firm last month.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nBlunt recently retired from Congress after 26 years in office. He held several prominent roles, chairing the Senate Rules Committee and Senate Republican Policy Committee and serving as the No. 2 Republican in the House. He was a trusted adviser to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).\\xa0\\nBlunt is the third senator from the 117th Congress to announce a new gig. Former Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) joined lobbying and law firm DLA Piper in a similar advisory role. Former Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio) joined the American Enterprise Institute as a public policy fellow.\\xa0\\nThe Missouri Republican, who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, will maintain his security clearance and continue to advise the intelligence community separate from his role at the firm. He’ll also stay on as the recently elected president of the State Historical Society of Missouri.\\nBlunt gained a reputation as a dealmaker and institutionalist. One of his last moves in Congress was passing the Electoral Count Reform Act, a bipartisan measure to clarify lawmakers’ role in certifying the presidential election and prevent a repeat of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tLobbying World: Utility trade group CEO to step down\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tBottom Line: JetBlue adds more lobbyists amid merger fight\\t\\n\\n“When Senator Blunt gets people in a room together, great things happen, and I look forward to seeing those results,” Neil Bradley, the top lobbyist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in a press release from Husch Blackwell Strategies.\\nBlunt does not plan on registering to lobby and will focus on advising clients, the firm said. After leaving Congress, senators must wait two years before lobbying their former colleagues.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nEx-lawmakers are increasingly choosing to advise clients rather than register to lobby after their lobbying prohibition ends, which keeps their clients hidden from the public.\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nNASHVILLE, Tenn. (WKRN) — Nearly two years after a plane crash claimed the lives of seven people, a newly-released report details the events that led up to the tragedy.\\nOn May 29, 2021, seven high-ranking members of Brentwood’s Remnant Fellowship Church were killed after a plane carrying them crashed into Percy Priest Lake, a reservoir just east of Nashville.\\n\\nThe seven on board the private jet were identified as:\\n\\nGwen Shamblin Lara\\nWilliam “Joe” Lara\\nDavid Martin\\nJennifer Martin\\nJonathan Walters\\nJessica Walters\\nBrandon Hannah\\n\\nGwen Shamblin Lara founded Remnant Fellowship Church in 1999 as an extension of her popular book “The Weigh Down Diet.” Her husband, William Lara, was an actor, best known for playing Tarzan in the television series, “Tarzan: The Epic Adventures.” Hannah was Gwen’s son-in-law, having married her daughter in 2003.\\nThe others, David and Jennifer Martin, and Jonathan and Jessica Walters, were members of the Remnant Fellowship Church. \\nThough NTSB doesn’t identify those involved in transportation accidents, local authorities previously identified William Lara as the pilot. \\nOn Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board released its report, which claimed the pilot became disoriented shortly after takeoff from Smyrna Airport.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tREAD: Full NTSB report from Percy Priest Lake plane crash\\t\\n\\n\\nIn the report, the NTSB claims the Cessna 501 took off, bound for West Palm Beach, Florida, and made a climbing right turn while entering the clouds above the airport. The plane then began to descend and the pilot did not initially respond to air traffic control (ATC) instructions.\\nThe pilot acknowledged the instructions after a second request by the ATC and began a climbing right turn followed by a left turn. The pilot then went radio silent and did not respond to the ATC. \\nThe plane soon descended rapidly and crashed into Percy Priest Lake at a high rate of speed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tRELATED: ‘The Way Down’: HBO documentary highlights founder of controversial Brentwood church\\t\\n\\n\\nAfter examining the wreckage, the NTSB concluded there was no evidence of any mechanical issues or failures that would have led to the crash. \\nFollowing the analysis of the flight track, it was concluded that the pilot was experiencing spatial disorientation shortly after takeoff. He was said to “not effectively use his instrumentation during takeoff and climb,” which he was not able to recover from to avoid the crash.\\nNTSB final crash reportDownload\\nThe report also reaches the conclusion that medication use or medical conditions were not a factor in the deadly crash.\\n\\n\\n'),\n",

       "  '\\n\\nNEW YORK (WPIX) — Even though former President Donald Trump has been indicted for his alleged role in a hush money payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels, it’s not guaranteed the fiery politician would serve time in jail or prison if he’s convicted, experts said.\\nTrump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records during his arraignment in a Manhattan court Tuesday. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFalsifying business records would normally be charged as misdemeanors, charges that would not usually result in prison time. But they were bumped up to felonies because they were done in an effort to commit or conceal other crimes, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg said. \\nEach felony count corresponds to one of the 34 documents the grand jury said contained a false statement about the payments, according to Politifact. \\nAs felony charges, each count carries a maximum of four years in prison, the New York Post reports, meaning the former president is technically facing a maximum 136-year sentence if convicted on all counts.

Cohen said he paid Daniels $130,000 through a shell company and was reimbursed by Trump, who claimed them as legal expenses.

You can’t have a guy at the top of the ticket who is under indictment — and If I was running against him, I would say that.”\\nThat said, an indictment that merely laid out charges that have already been predicted, and no more, could spell trouble for Bragg — and a silver lining for Trump.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nEven some Democrats privately worry that the case taken by the Manhattan D.A. is less compelling than the ongoing probes into three other matters: the events around the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, the discovery of documents bearing classified markings at Mar-a-Lago, and the attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election result in Georgia.\\nFurthermore, the most likely charge against Trump, regarding falsification of business records, is a misdemeanor rather than a felony, unless it can be shown to be linked to some other crime.\\xa0\\nThe most likely connection in this instance will be to allegations that the now-infamous $130,000 payment to adult actress Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign was a de facto campaign expenditure that was illegally concealed.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nPerhaps Bragg will reveal compelling new evidence in that regard.\\xa0\\nBut it’s worth noting that a broadly comparable case against John Edwards, the former Democratic senator who ran for president in 2004 and 2008, failed — in part because the defense argued that payments to a woman with whom he had an affair could have been made to limit personal embarrassment rather than to further his 2008 White House bid.\\nThe American public seems to have an unusually complicated view of the case.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nTwo major polls in recent days, one from ABC News/Ipsos and the other from CNN/SSRS, indicated that many Americans see the prosecution both as a welcome development and as politically motivated.\\nIn the CNN poll, 60 percent of Americans approved of the indictment while 52 percent said that politics played a “major role” in it.\\xa0\\nIn the ABC News poll, 45 percent of Americans said Trump should have been charged with a crime, compared to 32 percent who didn’t think so — yet a 47 percent plurality also said the charges were politically motivated.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThere is no question that the case has inflamed Trump’s supporters — and got them to open their wallets one more time. Trump aide Jason Miller claimed late Monday that Trump’s campaign had raised more than $8 million since news of the indictment broke.\\nBut for Trump, who lost the 2020 election by more than seven million votes, simply holding onto the loyalty of his existing supporters isn’t enough.\\nMore to the point, further inflammatory tweets or speeches from the former president could backfire. Trump warned late last month of “potential death & destruction” if he were charged.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThere has been some speculation that the judge in the case could consider a gag order for the former president or at least admonish him to avoid any comments that would come close to contempt of court.\\nBut any attempt to restrain Trump — a declared presidential candidate since November — would be a firestorm in and of itself.\\nFor the moment, authorities in New York are stiffening security measures.\\nAt a Monday news conference, New York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) warned against “violence or vandalism of any kind.” Police have been preparing for demonstrations for weeks.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tIRS to release plans for spending $80-billion funding boost\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tChinese Embassy warns lawmakers against meeting with Taiwan president\\t\\n\\nPresident Biden has avoided making any direct comment on the specifics of the case so far.\\nAsked Monday whether he was concerned about unrest, Biden told a reporter, “No, I have faith in the New York Police Department.”\\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.\\n\\n'),\n",

To accomplish this, in the profoundly immortal words of Dr. King, we must ‘transform this world-wide neighborhood into a world-wide brotherhood’; ‘We must learn to live together as brothers [and sisters] or perish together as fools’.”\\nThe day he was assassinated, King was in Memphis supporting the Memphis Sanitation Workers Strike. The civil rights legend, known for his nonviolent protests, believed the strike highlighted economic inequality in America.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe night before his assassination, King gave his last speech, “I’ve Been to the Mountaintop.”\\xa0\\n“Well, I don’t know what will happen now,” Martin Luther King, Jr. said. “We’ve got some difficult days ahead.

But I’m not concerned about that now. I just want to do God’s will.”\\n“And He’s allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I’ve looked over. And I’ve seen the promised land.

       "  '\\n\\nRepublicans are warning that the unprecedented indictment of former President Trump on multiple charges sets a dangerous precedent that will lower the bar for future political prosecutions while putting the nation on a precarious slippery slope.\\xa0\\nSome Republicans are comparing Trump’s indictment — over crimes related to the payment of $130,000 to an adult film actress — to the House Republican impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton in 1998 on charges related to his affair with a White House intern. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThey predict that indicting Trump will make future former presidents and other political figures more susceptible to politically motivated prosecutions. \\xa0\\nDemocrats counter with the refrain that no person is above the law, regardless of whether he served in the Oval Office. \\xa0\\nBut some Democrats were not thrilled to hear that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) would be the first prosecutor to indict Trump; the conduct he is targeting has been publicly known for five years and other prosecutors, including Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., passed on the opportunity. \\xa0\\n“I think it is a terrible precedent for the country. I think it’s bad for America, bad for the Republican Party and it’s bad for the political system in our country. Once you start down this path, there’s no way you’re going to reverse it. That’s what we saw with impeachment,” said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former member of the House GOP leadership. \\xa0\\n“We’re going to see political prosecutions brought, some of them for meritorious reasons, some of them to advance the careers of the prosecutors. But all of this is harmful to America and our political process,” he added. \\xa0\\nWeber said “another whole aspect” of the case is that Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, according to 10 of the most recent national polls. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“There are people in this vast country of ours who have less than sterling motivations and you want them to be inhibited by rules that we’ve established, informal rules, that are designed to protect the whole system,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Once this wall of precedent has been destroyed, we’re going to find people around the country who are going to find reasons to engage in political prosecutions,” he added, noting that some Republicans are talking about the possibility of bringing charges against President Biden or his son Hunter after he leaves office. \\xa0\\n“I don’t know if that’s likely or not but we’re going to see something somewhere,” he said. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nSome Republican officeholders are framing Trump’s indictment as motivated purely by politics.\\xa0\\n“These charges aren’t about enforcing the law. Democrats barely pretend they are. They are the left telling the nation, we’re in charge here. And if you threaten us, we will destroy you,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) tweeted last week. \\xa0\\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), a one-time adviser to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell’s (Ky.) leadership team, said “it’s extremely dangerous for our democracy to indict a former president unless there is an unequivocal violation representing a very significant offense.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“This does not appear to rise anywhere near that. In fact it appears to be extremely political from a distance,” he added. “So I think it sets a precedent, and it’s a very dangerous precedent for democracy. \\xa0\\n“It creates an atmosphere where the courts are being used as a political weapon,” he said. “It undermines I think the confidence of the American people in their democracy, in their legal system.”\\xa0\\nCritics of Bragg’s case, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), point out that Trump’s then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election and the statute of limitations in New York is two years for misdemeanors and five years for minor felonies. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThese critics believe Bragg will try to tie that payment to an effort to conceal another crime, most likely a violation of campaign finance law, to get around the statute of limitations.\\xa0\\nCruz noted that a similar charge was brought against former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and was thrown out at trial. Edwards used nearly $1 million in payments from his political backers to support his mistress during the 2008 campaign. Democrats at the time criticized the charges brought by a Republican prosecutor as politically motivated. \\xa0\\n“Bragg’s case is even weaker because [the New York law in question] is ordinarily a misdemeanor with a two-year statute of limitations, so he couldn’t bring the claim,” he said. “In order to get it to be a felony, there’s a separate New York statute, which requires you have a fraudulent business record that aided in another crime.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“He’s got to bootstrap presumably a federal campaign finance violation, which the federal government declined to bring,” Cruz explained. “The core allegation at the heart of Bragg’s case is that Trump mischaracterized a payment as legal fees when it was not in fact legal fees.\\xa0\\n“Hillary Clinton at the exact same time, in 2016 during the presidential campaign … paid $1 million for the Steele Dossier to be compiled — the fake and fantastical work of fiction that her oppo research team put together that tragically became the basis of [Special Counsel Robert’ Mueller’s] investigation,” he said.\\nCruz said Clinton also characterized the funding of the Steele Dossier research as legal payments, arguing that this shows Bragg is playing politics.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“It make obvious this is partisan politics,” he said. \\xa0\\nExperts say the precedent set by indicting Trump will reverberate into the future. \\xa0\\n“Every time a threshold is crossed in politics, it sets a predicate for another line to be crossed.

       "  '\\n\\nRepublicans are warning that the unprecedented indictment of former President Trump on multiple charges sets a dangerous precedent that will lower the bar for future political prosecutions while putting the nation on a precarious slippery slope.\\xa0\\nSome Republicans are comparing Trump’s indictment — over crimes related to the payment of $130,000 to an adult film actress — to the House Republican impeachment of then-President Bill Clinton in 1998 on charges related to his affair with a White House intern. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThey predict that indicting Trump will make future former presidents and other political figures more susceptible to politically motivated prosecutions. \\xa0\\nDemocrats counter with the refrain that no person is above the law, regardless of whether he served in the Oval Office. \\xa0\\nBut some Democrats were not thrilled to hear that Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg (D) would be the first prosecutor to indict Trump; the conduct he is targeting has been publicly known for five years and other prosecutors, including Bragg’s predecessor, Cyrus Vance Jr., passed on the opportunity. \\xa0\\n“I think it is a terrible precedent for the country. I think it’s bad for America, bad for the Republican Party and it’s bad for the political system in our country. Once you start down this path, there’s no way you’re going to reverse it. That’s what we saw with impeachment,” said Vin Weber, a Republican strategist and former member of the House GOP leadership. \\xa0\\n“We’re going to see political prosecutions brought, some of them for meritorious reasons, some of them to advance the careers of the prosecutors. But all of this is harmful to America and our political process,” he added. \\xa0\\nWeber said “another whole aspect” of the case is that Trump is the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, according to 10 of the most recent national polls. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“There are people in this vast country of ours who have less than sterling motivations and you want them to be inhibited by rules that we’ve established, informal rules, that are designed to protect the whole system,” he said.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n“Once this wall of precedent has been destroyed, we’re going to find people around the country who are going to find reasons to engage in political prosecutions,” he added, noting that some Republicans are talking about the possibility of bringing charges against President Biden or his son Hunter after he leaves office. \\xa0\\n“I don’t know if that’s likely or not but we’re going to see something somewhere,” he said. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nSome Republican officeholders are framing Trump’s indictment as motivated purely by politics.\\xa0\\n“These charges aren’t about enforcing the law. Democrats barely pretend they are. They are the left telling the nation, we’re in charge here. And if you threaten us, we will destroy you,” Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) tweeted last week. \\xa0\\nFormer Sen. Judd Gregg (R-N.H.), a one-time adviser to Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell’s (Ky.) leadership team, said “it’s extremely dangerous for our democracy to indict a former president unless there is an unequivocal violation representing a very significant offense.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“This does not appear to rise anywhere near that. In fact it appears to be extremely political from a distance,” he added. “So I think it sets a precedent, and it’s a very dangerous precedent for democracy. \\xa0\\n“It creates an atmosphere where the courts are being used as a political weapon,” he said. “It undermines I think the confidence of the American people in their democracy, in their legal system.”\\xa0\\nCritics of Bragg’s case, such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), point out that Trump’s then-lawyer, Michael Cohen, made the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 election and the statute of limitations in New York is two years for misdemeanors and five years for minor felonies. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThese critics believe Bragg will try to tie that payment to an effort to conceal another crime, most likely a violation of campaign finance law, to get around the statute of limitations.\\xa0\\nCruz noted that a similar charge was brought against former Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and was thrown out at trial. Edwards used nearly $1 million in payments from his political backers to support his mistress during the 2008 campaign. Democrats at the time criticized the charges brought by a Republican prosecutor as politically motivated. \\xa0\\n“Bragg’s case is even weaker because [the New York law in question] is ordinarily a misdemeanor with a two-year statute of limitations, so he couldn’t bring the claim,” he said. “In order to get it to be a felony, there’s a separate New York statute, which requires you have a fraudulent business record that aided in another crime.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“He’s got to bootstrap presumably a federal campaign finance violation, which the federal government declined to bring,” Cruz explained. “The core allegation at the heart of Bragg’s case is that Trump mischaracterized a payment as legal fees when it was not in fact legal fees.\\xa0\\n“Hillary Clinton at the exact same time, in 2016 during the presidential campaign … paid $1 million for the Steele Dossier to be compiled — the fake and fantastical work of fiction that her oppo research team put together that tragically became the basis of [Special Counsel Robert’ Mueller’s] investigation,” he said.\\nCruz said Clinton also characterized the funding of the Steele Dossier research as legal payments, arguing that this shows Bragg is playing politics.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“It make obvious this is partisan politics,” he said. \\xa0\\nExperts say the precedent set by indicting Trump will reverberate into the future. \\xa0\\n“Every time a threshold is crossed in politics, it sets a predicate for another line to be crossed.

       "  '\\n\\nThe unprecedented indictment of former President Trump creates a political puzzle and problem for Republican leaders in Washington who are divided over how to respond to it and have differing views about what it means for the future of their party.\\xa0\\nSome Republicans, such as Speaker Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), are lambasting the indictment as an “abuse of power” and a “weaponization” of the justice system, predicting it will fuel public support for Trump in 2024. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“The American people will not tolerate this injustice, and the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account,” McCarthy declared last week. \\xa0\\nBut other prominent Republicans, who want the party to move past Trump, such as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Senate GOP Whip John Thune (S.D.), are staying quiet about the news bombshell. \\xa0\\n“It seems like he’s gotten the base strongly behind him. Does that change over time? We’ll see, especially since there’s more legal trouble going on,” said one Senate Republican aide. “It’s probably prudent for Republicans to take a deep breath and see what he’s actually charged with.\\xa0\\n“It’s a puzzle right now and no one really knows how this all plays out, politically and legally,” the aide added. \\xa0\\nThe aide warned that Republicans racing to defend Trump have “really put themselves out there on a limb.” \\xa0\\n\\nRelated coverage on the Trump indictment from The Hill:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTrump’s New York legal drama: What’s next\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHow GOP leaders are responding to Trump’s arrest\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile pinning Trump case to campaign laws, Bragg eyes a backup plan\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThune pans Trump indictment as ‘political agenda run amok’\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCould Trump face jail time if convicted?

Ted Cruz (Texas), are lambasting the indictment as an “abuse of power” and a “weaponization” of the justice system, predicting it will fuel public support for Trump in 2024. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“The American people will not tolerate this injustice, and the House of Representatives will hold Alvin Bragg and his unprecedented abuse of power to account,” McCarthy declared last week. \\xa0\\nBut other prominent Republicans, who want the party to move past Trump, such as Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Senate GOP Whip John Thune (S.D.), are staying quiet about the news bombshell. \\xa0\\n“It seems like he’s gotten the base strongly behind him. Does that change over time? We’ll see, especially since there’s more legal trouble going on,” said one Senate Republican aide. “It’s probably prudent for Republicans to take a deep breath and see what he’s actually charged with.\\xa0\\n“It’s a puzzle right now and no one really knows how this all plays out, politically and legally,” the aide added. \\xa0\\nThe aide warned that Republicans racing to defend Trump have “really put themselves out there on a limb.” \\xa0\\n\\nRelated coverage on the Trump indictment from The Hill:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTrump’s New York legal drama: What’s next\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHow GOP leaders are responding to Trump’s arrest\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWhile pinning Trump case to campaign laws, Bragg eyes a backup plan\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThune pans Trump indictment as ‘political agenda run amok’\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCould Trump face jail time if convicted?

John Cornyn (R-Texas), an adviser to the Senate GOP leadership team, said last month he would prefer to see House Republicans working on the issues that helped them win the majority instead of battling with Bragg.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nHe offered a measured statement on the indictment.\\xa0\\n“It looks to me like this is an opportunity for this DA to make headlines and gain publicity,” he said Friday. \\xa0\\nSome of Trump’s critics within the party think that even if the latest development helps him consolidate support in the party, it may further weaken his viability in a general-election matchup against President Biden and hurt the GOP brand. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I really, truly think that there is fatigue over the circus that comes with Donald Trump. I think a lot of people want to support him and be supportive of him and agree with him on the policies but are fatigued by the circus,” said Matt Dole, a Republican consultant based in Ohio, a Senate battleground in 2024. \\xa0\\nDole said the silence of prominent Republicans such as McConnell and Thune reflects that “fatigue.”\\xa0\\n“I think you’re seeing people just tired of the circus,” he said, noting GOP leaders are bracing for the possibility of additional indictments from Justice Department special counsel Jack Smith and Georgia’s Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“There’s no doubt that you could make the case that this is a politically motivated indictment,” he said of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s case against Trump. “Republicans can think it’s a political indictment and also be sick of the circus.\\xa0\\n“If you think that other indictments are coming and you’re fatigued, the notion of coming out and saying, ‘This is a political indictment,’ well, then the next one you’re going to have to say something,” he added. “Staying quiet then I think is just an acknowledgement that there’s more to come and we’re going to let him sort it out in the court.” \\xa0\\nOne Republican strategist said Trump already struggled with swing suburban voters because of his pugnacious style and penchant for controversy.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“An indictment like this with two more potentially coming down in the future really hurts his chances to win back these suburban voters,” the strategist said. \\xa0\\n“For any Republican candidate to succeed in a presidential race, they need to bring these right-of-center voters back into the fold and this latest development really hurts his chances to be the best candidate do that,” the strategist said. \\xa0\\nOther Republicans think the indictment will pave the way for Trump to win the nomination next year. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think this is an enormous political gift to Donald Trump,” Cruz said on his podcast, “Verdict.” \\xa0\\n“If I were a Democrat, I might well report Alvin Bragg to the Federal Election Commission for making the single greatest in-kind contribution to a presidential campaign in history,” he added. “This will help Trump.” \\xa0\\nRoss K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, predicted the indictment will strengthen Trump’s support from the Republican base. \\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think it solidifies in a general election that portion of the Republican electorate that for a long time has been committed to Donald Trump. I think they’ll stick to him like a stamp sticks to a love letter,” he said. \\xa0\\nAnd he projected “there may be initial sympathy” for Trump from independent and swing voters.\\xa0\\n“That may be based on the complexity of the charges, which of course we haven’t seen yet,” he added, noting that Democrats did well in the 1998 midterm election after House Republicans impeached former President Clinton for having an affair with a White House intern. \\xa0\\nSome Republican strategists think Bragg’s case could stretch out for months — well into the 2024 election cycle. \\xa0\\n“If it’s being litigated, it’s going to be in appeals court, they’re going to be appealing different aspects of the case,” said Brian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide. “It’s helping Trump raise money now, no doubt.\\xa0\\n“It’s going to help Trump raise a lot of money for his reelection,” he added.\\xa0\\nTrump’s campaign and allied groups, including the National Republican Senatorial Committee, sent out fundraising appeals citing the indictment immediately after news of it broke Thursday. \\xa0Darling said McConnell’s early silence on Trump’s indictment wasn’t surprising. \\xa0\\n“McConnell doesn’t like Trump. He’s not going to make any statement that would be beneficial to Trump’s potential reelection,” he said. \\xa0\\nThune, who has stood in as the Senate Republican leader in recent weeks while McConnell recuperates from a concussion, indicated that Republicans are getting tired of having to regularly answer questions about Trump’s legal problems instead of talking about President Biden’s record or problems afflicting the economy, such as inflation. \\xa0\\nAsked if it’s frustrating to keep on getting sucked into Trump’s legal dramas, Thune replied: “What do you think?”\\xa0\\nAt the same time, Thune acknowledged that “a lot of our members, colleagues” are wondering why the Manhattan district attorney is prioritizing charges against Trump that other prosecutors have declined to pursue “when there are so many serious crime issues in New York.” \\xa0\\nBragg has come under fire from Republican lawmakers for circulating a memo to prosecutors in January of last year advising them to only seek prison sentences for the most serious crimes. \\xa0\\nHis record of downgrading 52 percent of the felony cases in his jurisdiction down to misdemeanors and winning convictions in just more than 50 percent of felony cases has also drawn criticism. \\xa0\\n“How can President Trump avoid prosecution in New York?” asked Sen.

And that’s exactly what happened. And that was the start of a downward spiral.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFetterman, who defeated Mehmet Oz in one of the most closely-watched and high stakes Senate races in 2022, was released from the hospital on Friday and will spend time with his family at home in Pennsylvania while the Senate is on a two week recess.

       "  '\\n\\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) hit back Monday at New York Mayor Eric Adams (D) for warning her to be on her “best behavior” during protests against former President Trump’s arraignment on Tuesday. \\n“Delusional @NYCMayor is trying to intimidate, threaten, and stop me from using my 1st amendment rights to peacefully protest the Democrat’s unconstitutional weaponization of our justice system against our top Republican Presidential candidate, President Trump,” Greene wrote on Twitter. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nGreene has been among the many Republicans who have railed against Trump’s indictment last week over his involvement in hush money payments to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 campaign to cover up an alleged affair. Greene, along with Trump and his allies, has decried Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg’s investigation as politically motivated. \\n“Mayor Adams should be more concerned about NY citizens and taxpayers being murdered, raped, robbed, and carjacked than an elected Member of Congress coming to town,” the Georgia Republican tweeted. “Or should I be the one concerned that the mayor of NYC will weaponize his government or maybe his thugs like DA Alvin Bragg against me?”\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland AG accuses Baltimore’s Catholic Church of widespread sexual abuse\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tFive killed in Missouri tornado as storms threaten more destruction\\t\\n\\nAdams had warned Greene over her plans to attend a protest in Manhattan with the New York Young Republican Club in support of Trump.\\n“People like Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is known to spread misinformation and hate speech … she stated she’s coming to town,” Adams said at a press conference earlier on Monday. “While you’re in town, be on your best behavior.”\\nTrump had previously called for protests ahead of his potential indictment earlier this month, sparking concerns among officials that the demonstrations could turn violent. The New York City Police Department said Sunday that it is “ready to respond” to any protests during Trump’s court appearance, noting that its officers were already “placed on alert.”\\n\\n'),\n",

He briefly addressed a reporter’s question that day about potential unrest in New York due to Trump’s indictment, saying only that he had confidence in the New York Police Department to keep things from getting out of hand.\\nAlso on Tuesday, the president’s Twitter account stayed far away from Trump news, instead being filled with posts about his economic agenda, the lack of a budget proposal from House Republicans and the results of the men’s and women’s NCAA basketball tournaments.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think they are doing it correctly so far, and I hope it continues, which is basically to not get into the story,” said Matt Bennett, a co-founder of the centrist think tank Third Way.\\nWhile Democrats widely agree it is in the White House’s best interest to stay out of the way while Trump reminds voters of his various legal issues, there is some frustration within the party that Biden’s efforts to focus on his agenda and issues relevant to the public is being drowned out by media coverage of the former president.\\n“If folks want to talk about Trump and 2024 that’s fine.

Ron DeSantis may have a problem when it comes to luring one key voter bloc: independents.\\xa0\\nWhile DeSantis overwhelmingly won his gubernatorial reelection in November, he struggled particularly with independent women voters. A recent\\xa0Emerson College poll\\xa0showed that more than 51 percent of Florida independent voters disapproved of his job performance as governor, with more than 61 percent of women disapproving of his leadership.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think independent women rejected a lot of the hardcore Republicanism,” said Susan Del Percio, a longtime Republican strategist. “They’re not willing to go there.

On Monday alone, he signed a bill allowing Floridians to carry guns without a state permit, while the Florida Senate approved a six-week abortion ban backed by DeSantis.\\nBut as he prepares to launch a bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, he\\xa0faces the looming possibility that his governing record could come back to haunt him, especially if he makes it through the primary and faces a broader electorate of more moderate and independent voters.\\n“The challenge for DeSantis is that he outflanks [former President] Trump to the right on COVID, colleges and crime and while helpful in a primary, ostensibly those positions could hurt him with independents in a general,” Martin Sweet, a political science professor at Purdue University, said. “This is the classic poli sci 101 ‘primary paradox.’ ”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFormer Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said that while DeSantis has proven that he can govern effectively, there’s a risk in moving too far to the right.\\n“DeSantis has, in the Republican field, the most compelling governing record,” Curbelo said. “I think where he is taking too much risk is in trying to out-Trump Trump, and a lot of what he’s doing is to prove that he’s more conservative than Trump, but that doesn’t seem right.”\\nCamille Mumford, a communications director at Emerson College who has been involved in some of the analysis of the school’s poll, said the results among independents is “definitely an issue for his candidacy.” Mumford said weakness in the “pivotal” voting bloc, particularly among women, could potentially cost him the nomination.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nTo be sure, DeSantis has a track record of success with independent voters that he can point to. He won 52 percent of independents voters in the November election, and polling shows that he performs better among independents than Trump. A\\xa0survey from Quinnipiac University\\xa0released last week found that 43 percent of independents have a favorable opinion of DeSantis compared to only 32 percent for the former president.\\nWhether that kind of support can translate to a national electorate, however, remains an open question.\\n“I think a lot of his support with independents last year came from the pandemic policies.

And Florida voters aren’t the same as Iowa voters or Virginia voters or whoever else.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said there’s little reason for DeSantis to worry about his appeal among independents, at least for now. He said that when he enters the 2024 race, his first priority will be winning the GOP primary — and he’ll need to energize the Republican Party’s conservative base to do that.\\n“‘Geez, Ron isn’t doing great with independents in the general’ isn’t a thought going through Team DeSantis right now,” Heye said. “If he runs, he’ll be in a primary first and that’s where his focus is and will be. In the meantime, most of what independent voters are hearing about him is coming through the lens of unfriendly media that spends a lot more time talking about book banning and Disney, than, say, job creation in Florida.”\\xa0\\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said that any challenge DeSantis faces with independent voters may not be unique to the Florida governor.

What he will need, however, is the loyalty of the GOP and its voters.\\n“The GOP is so far right that to appeal to the party means taking stands that will be tough to sell at a broad level,” Zelizer said. “The problem is that Trump owns the rest of the space so it will be hard for DeSantis to compete with him.

       "  '\\n\\nWhen he announces his presidential bid in the coming months, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis may have a problem when it comes to luring one key voter bloc: independents.\\xa0\\nWhile DeSantis overwhelmingly won his gubernatorial reelection in November, he struggled particularly with independent women voters. A recent\\xa0Emerson College poll\\xa0showed that more than 51 percent of Florida independent voters disapproved of his job performance as governor, with more than 61 percent of women disapproving of his leadership.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“I think independent women rejected a lot of the hardcore Republicanism,” said Susan Del Percio, a longtime Republican strategist. “They’re not willing to go there. And his rhetoric has gotten uglier over time, so it’s become a bigger turnoff.”\\nIndeed, DeSantis has carved out a reputation for himself as a darling of the modern conservative movement by pushing a long list of hard-line policies and picking a near-constant stream of public political fights throughout his four years in the Florida governor’s mansion.\\xa0\\nHe famously bucked federal public health officials in his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, signed into law a controversial measure banning classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity and led an effort to strip Disney of its self-governing district in Central Florida over the company’s criticism of that law.\\nAnd with the state’s annual legislative session now in full swing, other controversial policies are making their way to DeSantis’s desk. On Monday alone, he signed a bill allowing Floridians to carry guns without a state permit, while the Florida Senate approved a six-week abortion ban backed by DeSantis.\\nBut as he prepares to launch a bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, he\\xa0faces the looming possibility that his governing record could come back to haunt him, especially if he makes it through the primary and faces a broader electorate of more moderate and independent voters.\\n“The challenge for DeSantis is that he outflanks [former President] Trump to the right on COVID, colleges and crime and while helpful in a primary, ostensibly those positions could hurt him with independents in a general,” Martin Sweet, a political science professor at Purdue University, said. “This is the classic poli sci 101 ‘primary paradox.’ ”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFormer Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R-Fla.) said that while DeSantis has proven that he can govern effectively, there’s a risk in moving too far to the right.\\n“DeSantis has, in the Republican field, the most compelling governing record,” Curbelo said. “I think where he is taking too much risk is in trying to out-Trump Trump, and a lot of what he’s doing is to prove that he’s more conservative than Trump, but that doesn’t seem right.”\\nCamille Mumford, a communications director at Emerson College who has been involved in some of the analysis of the school’s poll, said the results among independents is “definitely an issue for his candidacy.” Mumford said weakness in the “pivotal” voting bloc, particularly among women, could potentially cost him the nomination.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nTo be sure, DeSantis has a track record of success with independent voters that he can point to. He won 52 percent of independents voters in the November election, and polling shows that he performs better among independents than Trump. A\\xa0survey from Quinnipiac University\\xa0released last week found that 43 percent of independents have a favorable opinion of DeSantis compared to only 32 percent for the former president.\\nWhether that kind of support can translate to a national electorate, however, remains an open question.\\n“I think a lot of his support with independents last year came from the pandemic policies.

And Florida voters aren’t the same as Iowa voters or Virginia voters or whoever else.”\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said there’s little reason for DeSantis to worry about his appeal among independents, at least for now. He said that when he enters the 2024 race, his first priority will be winning the GOP primary — and he’ll need to energize the Republican Party’s conservative base to do that.\\n“‘Geez, Ron isn’t doing great with independents in the general’ isn’t a thought going through Team DeSantis right now,” Heye said. “If he runs, he’ll be in a primary first and that’s where his focus is and will be. In the meantime, most of what independent voters are hearing about him is coming through the lens of unfriendly media that spends a lot more time talking about book banning and Disney, than, say, job creation in Florida.”\\xa0\\nJulian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University, said that any challenge DeSantis faces with independent voters may not be unique to the Florida governor.

       "  '\\n\\nThe Manhattan District Attorney’s history-making decision to indict former President Trump last week only marks the first possible charges against Trump, who faces myriad ongoing legal challenges. \\nSince leaving the White House, Trump has been in the center of legal cases related to his time in office, his actions after leaving office, and his business dealings. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nLast Thursday, he became the first president — current or former — to be indicted on criminal charges, in relation to his alleged involvement in a hush-money payment made to adult-film star Stormy Daniels to cover up an alleged affair. \\nThough the exact charges Trump is facing in Manhattan will remain under seal until his arraignment on Tuesday, legal experts have said the case pales in comparison to the other legal challenges the former president is facing. \\nHere’s where those other cases stand ahead of his arraignment. \\nGeorgia probe into election interference\\nFulton County District Attorney Fani Willis\\xa0opened an investigation into whether Trump interfered with the 2020 election in early 2021, after it was made public that the former president made a\\xa0phone call\\xa0to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to tell him to “find” about 11,000 votes so that Trump could win the state.\\n“All I want to do is this,” the president said in the phone recording. “I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state.”\\nThe grand jury investigating Trump’s role in the 2020 election submitted their findings in a report in February, parts of which were released to the public. The Georgia grand jury ultimately found that there was no widespread fraud in the election, and encouraged the prosecution of witnesses who may have lied in their testimonies. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nIt remains unclear who those witnesses are. Ultimately, the decision to pursue charges rests with Willis. \\nIn multiple interviews, jury forewoman Emily Kohrs hinted that Trump and multiple allies of his could face a variety of charges as a result of the investigation. She was criticized by Trump and his lawyers for speaking publicly about the probe. \\nThe former president filed a motion last month\\xa0to prevent the use of any evidence presented to the grand jury in his investigation. Georgia prosecutors asked to speak with a Trump’s lawyer last month about the case, but the lawyer planned to deny the request. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nJustice Department’s investigations into Trump\\nAttorney General Merrick Garland appointed Justice Department prosecutor Jack Smith last year to serve as the special counsel in two federal investigations against Trump. \\nOne of the the investigations is focused on whether Trump or his allies unlawfully interfered with the certification of the 2020 election results or tried to stop the peaceful transfer of power. \\nFormer White House chief of staff\\xa0Mark Meadows\\xa0and a group of other Trump staffers are being forced to testify\\xa0before a grand jury hearing evidence in the probe. \\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, who will also be forced to testify in the probe, has said he has “nothing to hide.”\\nThe second federal investigation spearheaded by Smith related to Trump’s handling of hundreds of classified documents found at his private residence in Mar-a-Lago last year.

The second lawsuit was filed in 2022 and is based off of a Truth Social post, where Trump said Carroll’s accusation is a “hoax and a lie” and a “complete scam.”\\nThe second lawsuit also includes allegations of battery from the 1990s, when Carroll claims Trump assaulted her, made possible after New York enacted the Adult Survivors Act, which created a one-year time frame for adult survivors of rape and sexual assault to file lawsuits against the alleged perpetrator even after the statute of limitations had expired.\\xa0\\nThe judge overseeing the case rejected a motion to combine the two cases into one last month, saying that the cases would benefit from having two separate trials.

Therefore, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of Dominion on the element of falsity,” the ruling read.\\nThe network’s lawyers have defended the conservative cable news company on First Amendment grounds, saying the claims being made by Trump and his allies were newsworthy.\\xa0\\n“Even if the neutral report privilege did apply, the evidence does not support that FNN conducted good-faith, disinterested reporting,” Davis wrote, also rejecting Fox’s other First Amendment defenses.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nThe outcome of the closely watched case — which has already produced a number of embarrassing headlines for the nation’s cable news leader — is certain to have major implications for Fox’s future and media law more generally.\\xa0\\n“We are gratified by the Court’s thorough ruling soundly rejecting all of Fox’s arguments and defenses, and finding as a matter of law that their statements about Dominion are false,” Dominion said in a statement to The Hill on Friday. “We look forward to going to trial.”\\nFox said in its own statement that “this case is and always has been about the First Amendment protections of the media’s absolute right to cover the news.”\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Fox will continue to fiercely advocate for the rights of free speech and a free press as we move into the next phase of these proceedings,” the network said.\\nThe process of discovery has been an embarrassing one for the nation’s top-rated network, with a number of private communications and depositions by leading hosts and executives at the network in the post-election period brought

Dominion showed.\\xa0\\n“Maybe Sean and Laura went too far,” Murdoch wrote to Scott. “All very well for Sean to tell you he was in despair about Trump but what did he tell his viewers?”\\nDavis ruled there was no factual dispute that all of the statements that Dominion is suing over are false.\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“Dominion has offered proof demonstrating that the allegations were substantially false,” Davis wrote. “Comparing the allegations at issue to the truth, the truth would have likely had a different outcome on the average viewer, as the statements at issue were dramatically different than the truth.”\\n“In fact, although it cannot be attributed directly to Fox’s statements, it is noteworthy that some Americans still believe the election was rigged,” the judge added.\\nA jury trial could force several of Fox’s biggest stars onto the witness stand, with lawyers for both sides last week expressing a desire to call hosts like Tucker Carlson, Hannity, Lou Dobbs, Bret Baier, Maria Bartiromo and Jeanine Pirro.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\nFox’s attorneys and spokespeople have accused the voting systems company of “cherry picking” quotes from its employees to drum up media attention around its case.\\xa0\\nNeither side has shown any interest publicly in settling the case, which is unusual given the high financial stakes involved and public relations lashing an open court proceeding would pose to the country’s top cable news company.\\xa0\\nDavis’ judgement also came on the heels of a separate lawsuit filed by a former top producer at Fox who alleges she was coached in “a coercive and intimidating manner” to protect executives and on-air talent as part of the Dominion suit.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n“They destroy people,” Abby Grossberg, the producer who worked for Maria Bartiromo, Tucker Carlson and other top hosts at the network, said during a recent\\xa0interview with NBC News. “I realized that the answers that they wanted me to say were putting me in a very vulnerable position to be the company scapegoat.”\\nFox has denied Grossberg’s allegations, saying in a statement this week “the assertion that Ms. Grossberg was coached or intimidated into being dishonest during her Dominion deposition is patently false.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tDominion can call Murdoch to testify in Fox News lawsuit, judge rules\\xa0\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tMaryland sheriff charged in scheme involving machine guns\\t\\n\\n“We will continue to vigorously defend Fox against her unmeritorious legal claims, which are riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees,” the network said.\\xa0\\nIn order to find Fox liable for the damages it seeks, Dominion will have to prove to a jury that the network acted with actual malice, or reckless disregard for the truth, in publishing Trump’s election claims, which Davis, in his summary judgement opinion, determined were false.\\xa0\\nA jury trial in the case is slated to begin April 17.\\xa0\\n\\n'),\n",

Spending dropped 4.1 percent during the work week, compared to 2.1 percent during the weekend.\\xa0\\n“The strongest advocates for the policy have been supporters of small businesses and retailers, like chambers of commerce and outdoor entertainment providers like the golf and barbecue industries,” the report read.\\nThe golf industry has long backed DST, which gives golfers more sunlight to hit the links after work, The Hill previously reported. Florida, Rubio’s home state, has by far the most golf courses of any state and relies on the sport to drive tourism.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tLobbying World: Utility trade group CEO to step down\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tBottom Line: JetBlue adds more lobbyists amid merger fight\\t\\n\\nInsurers, eager to reduce motor vehicle crashes, have also lobbied Congress on the issue.\\xa0\\nJimi Grande, senior vice president of federal and political affairs for the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC), said that the transition between standard time and DST leads to spikes in fatal accidents driven by sleep deprivation and circadian rhythm misalignment.\\xa0\\n“To the extent that a consistent time system would alleviate those issues, NAMIC believes Congress can and should consider a legislative solution that helps reduce risks for policyholders,” Grande told The Hill.\\xa0\\n\\n'),\n",

Like, as a person, I think Trump is funny and insightful.”\\nCarlson has separately faced widespread criticism for is framing of the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6. which he described earlier this month as “mostly peaceful chaos” and sought to downplay the severity of over several episodes of his nightly program. \\n“This is transparently political, it’s meant to take him out of the presidential race,” Carlson said on Thursday of Trump’s indictment. “That’s not allowed.” \\n\\n'),\n",
